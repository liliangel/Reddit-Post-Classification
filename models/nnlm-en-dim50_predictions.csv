2,Reading considered disrespectful rude - using your phone totaly fine This christmas I was invited to the family of my step mother one evening hosted by her mother the other by her daughter For both occations I brought books since sleeping over was basically forced on me After Christmas dinner all of them started talking while staying on their phones for 90% of the time none of the topics were especially interesting or difficult to follow but nonetheless they did not manage to really discuss anything and seemed to only try to responed in the least demanding way So I decided to get my book reread of True Grit by Charles Portis since I can manage better conversation while reading than they can muster while on their phones and just could not cope doing nothing but listening to this farce When I sat down to read my father started berating me how rude and disrespectful I am to the host and the other people talking at the table with my stepmother also chiming in and supporting the view of my father I excused myself for the evening and went to sleep early The next day after dinner they were discussing how I had to work on my social skills and behaviour unless I want to upset people in the future When did mindnumbing phone use get socially more accepted than reading a book Am I the only one spotting the hipocrisy in all of this,books

4,Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago So I am reading Discworld for the first time yes I know quite late to the party on this enjoying it so far but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor I thought I would share it here because it shows that this kind of thing has been prevalent in fantasy and to be fair many other kinds of literature for a long time now From The Light Fantastic I do not think this counts as a spoiler since it does not give away any of the plot mods please let me know if I am wrong : this particular hero was a heroine A redheaded one Now there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one is shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at lenh about leather thighboots and naked blades Words like full round and even pert creep into the narrative until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down Which is all rather silly because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword is not about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer And then Pratchett does communicate that this character is attractive but he does so almost grudgingly as though it is some kind of concession to the reader: Oh well all right The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath a heavy-duty manicure and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling is Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chainmail soft boots and a short sword All right maybe the boots were leather But not black This book was published in 1986 so this was an interesting and funny glimpse into the fact that the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy which still persists today has been around for a long time,books
5,Is it normal to not remember anything from books read one year ago I’ve just looked through books that I read in 2020 and I was surprised to see that I do not remember any of it I am convinced that if I opened any of those books now it would be like reading it for the first time I mainly read classics non-fiction and philosophy I love reading but it’s disappointing to find out that I’m not able to talk about books I’ve read because I can’t remember ideas or the plot Is it normal Is it a sign that I’m not attentive enough while reading,books
6,Quick thought about the Trafalmadorians of Slaughterhouse 5 So here is a thought I just had When Vonnegut published slaughterhouse 5 readers only had access to books and stories through paper And therefore they only interacted with books with their eyes and hands We also know that Trafalmadorians are creatures that mainly feature an eye and a hand We as readers also see a book is tale as an ensemble more than a page-to-page or moment-to-moment action We can freely see what happenned before and what will happen whenever we want we are unstuck in the narration Just as the trafalmadorians Finally the zoo Whenever as a group of readers or consumers of any media we experience a story the characters are put in a mental zoo of sorts as we can tune in or out of the zoo whenever we want and the characters will still be there So my point is could the aliens featured in Vonnegut is book be taken as a metaphor for the reader PS: English is not my first language so apologies for any spelling grammatical errors,books
7,The Silmarillion is the most important book in Tolkien is canon and nothing less than a work of art A couple years ago I bought a copy of J R R Tolkien is transcription of the story of Kullervo a very prominent figure in the Kalevala a compilation of Finnish folklore and mythology akin to the Four Ancient Books of Wales and the Cycles of Irish mythology In this book a foreword was written by the editor Verlyn Flieger which expounded on Tolkien is admiration of the Kalevala and what it meant to the Finnish—for the Kalevala was compiled and publicized at a time when Finland was occupied by Russia and Finnish culture was being suppressed to encourage obeisance The Kalevala became something like a rallying cry for the Finnish galvanizing their revolution against their oppressors and contributed to the eventual revolution that saw Finland declaring independence from Russia in 1917 According to Flieger this level of national and cultural pride deeply affected Tolkien It was the man is ambition allegedly to create a mythology that was wholly British wholly for his home country for he knew as a linguist and philologist that most British tales had in fact come from somewhere else—King Arthur absconded from Cymry Wales for example by the Anglo-Saxons And this is why the Silmarillion specifically is the most important of all of Tolkien is works: it encapsulates the spirit of why he created Middle-earth in the first place The Silmarillion like much of Tolkien is work is difficult to read for many — it is as dry as a textbook they say And that is because it is essentially a textbook Like the Kalevala that inspired Tolkien so greatly the Silmarillion was an entirely fictional compilation of all the stories Tolkien had envisioned for his world inspired and invigorated by Tolkien is passion for his work and his nation If you read the Silmarillion you can see just how deeply the man cared for his world and the stories he had to tell—how passionate he was for a place that did not exist but for in his mind and now the minds of all who read his work The Silmarillion embodies the spirit of Middle-earth the reason for its existence more completely than The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings could ever hope to do It is a well-known story by now but Middle-earth was invented so the languages Tolkien was creating would have a home; and in a similar fashion I believe The Hobbit and LOTR were created so the Silmarillion could be published as Tolkien is truest labor of love,books
8,We by Yevgeni Zamyatin vs 1984 by George Orwell I’ve just finisher reading We I read 1974 a couple of months ago and I enjoyed it but I figured I should read the novel that Orwell modeled 1984 on as well Now look I wasn’t surprised that 1984 was similar to We after all Orwell admitted taking inspiration from Zamyatin What I was surpriser by was however how similar the plot was Two novels that criticise totalitarianism are bound to be similar in one way or another but I feel like Orwell just plain ripped off the story It became clear 20 pages into reading We and by the end of the novel it got quite absurd With that out of the way I must also admit that We seems like the superior work in absolutely every single aspect The prose is a lot more complex and nuanced the political critique is not so obvious and direct I found it really subtle and even humorous at times the whole plot however similar is a lot better paced and there is no point in the book where I felt it dragged without much purpose Orwell seemed to be very motivated to beat the reader over the head with the same idea for too many pages at a time which is something you don’t feel while reading We What are your thoughts I still have a fond opinion on 1984 but We is the better work of art by an obviously more capable writer when it comes to fiction I know Orwell was a good journalist and an outstanding political thinker,books
9,What are some tropes you would like to see more often in books They can be related to the characters the storyline relationships ect I have seen quite a few people talking about overrated tropes they dislike so I think it would be interesting to hear what people would like to read about instead So what are some tropes you think deserve more appreciation Some of mine are: Main characters who do not end up with each other when there is romance involved in the book Friends to Lovers Friends with benefits-relationships Morally grey protagonists Side note: I am not sure if morally grey is the right term for it but by it I mean characters who think they are doing the right thing but in reality it causes harm for others Not the type of jerks who think of themselves as better than others and treat the people around them badly on purpose,books
10,I just finished Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry RIP SPOILERS I know this book has been discussed but not in about six months so far as I can tell “There are many like it but this one is mine” I guess It took a long time about 400 pages for me to get sucked in to this book McMurtry was a 3000 words a day guy and I think that contributes to the sprawl of this book I think he probably drove his editors crazy but even in 1986 his stature may have been too great for him to be bullied into culling the word count I don’t think it suffers for it but people might be liable to give up before it gets really good To me this book is proof that character is the most important element of story telling and that plot is irrelevant This book is not about a cattle drive to Montana That’s just the canvas The brush strokes are about unrequited love Dish loves Lorena Gus loves Clara Newt wants to be loved by Call It is also about how the lives we lead are rarely deliberate Clara marries Bob for dubious reasons because she doesn’t want to be challenged as an equal she wants to be the alpha Call goes North because he’s bored Gus goes because of Clara and because he can’t leave Call Deets and Pea go out of attachment to Gus and Call The rest go because they need money It’s the doom of them all and why Not one person sits down and interrogates their reasoning for the lives they lead And how many of us do Perhaps I’ve missed a few but these are the chief themes I picked up I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe McMurtry belongs with Cormac McCarthy as the greatest authors about the American West If you enjoyed this type of book I can’t recommend Shogun by James Clavell enough,books

24,r CryptoTechnology now only allows text submissions - no images videos or links Hi folks Based on [feedback] https: www reddit com r CryptoTechnology comments 9gon8f what_can_we_do_better_rcryptotechnology thank you by the way and based on our own internal discussions we have decided to only allow text submissions to our subreddit This will inevitably reduce the amount of posts we receive but it will provide higher quality technology focused discussions that belong here We have done this as it is almost impossible for us to differentiate what blog posts and links are submitted in an attempt to shill and which ones are an attempt to provoke thoughtful technical discussion For example anyone can post a link to a new coin or shill blog and simply say I want a technical discussion We do realize that certain blog posts may invoke great technical discussion revolving around announcements new coins and so on and for those we ask that you link the post in your text submission but also: 1 Provide some context around the link what is interesting about it 2 Provide a short summary of what the blog has written about 3 Provide thought-provoking technical analysis over the post 4 Ask proper or provoking questions about the technology Example of what would not be okay for a text post that revolves around a blog link: title: x coin has released new tech called xblockchain text inside: what do you guys think or what is this Example of what would be okay: title: x coin has released new tech called xblockchain text inside: it looks like x coin finally released xblockchain which is supposed to do xthing and xthing This would change the xindustry because currently we are lacking proper feeless transaction history collaboration I am a bit confused about the xart technology because in order for it to seamlessly integrate they would have to what do you guys think Now we are not saying you need to be an expert in blockchain technology or that you need to understand everything you are talking about or reading about but simply put effort into any text post that revolves around a blog post as to make sure it provokes technical discussion We are not r CryptoBlogPosts r CryptoNews or r CryptoSubmitALinkAndLeave Put effort into it and we will likely approve and keep the post on our subreddit We will remove any submissions that we deem not thought provoking or technical enough or worse: low effort As for normal text submissions try to stay on-point and technical Follow our rules: 1 No shilling spamming manipulation 2 No memes low quality posts low effort posts 3 No pricing discussion no prediction posts You get the drill In a nutshell we want to provide quality content revolving around technical discussions for cryptocurrency blockchain technology We want to be the place where folks can come to avoid shilling spam hodling pricing predictions recommendations fomo-ing and so on The only content you should see here is users participating in pure technical discussions revolving around coins and their real-world use something you simply ca not find anywhere else A vision like this requires intense scrutiny and moderation so please be patient if your post was flagged we will review it as soon as possible Shoot over a message to our mods if it is been longer than 12 hours Cheers everyone looking forward to your submissions,CryptoTechnology
25,I really want to know about Smart contracts &amp; Blockchain technology Hi guys Me and Friend want to make a project for final year in college 4months So we decided to Create a own Blockchain But we realize that creating a blockchain is not that simple I am searching about cryptocurrency last 6 months itself but I do not known how to create a smart contract I known basic concepts in programming languages but I do not know how to apply practically : I am newbie in programing languages But I really interested to study about Blockchain &amp; smart contracts because decentralization is a big thing for our future Any ideas for creating a useful smart contracts will be welcomed : Sorry if I made any grammatical mistakes English is my second lang :,languages
26,IDEA: Using smart contracts to rent apartments or other things So I was thinking about how we can get away from the credit score system and something I think I realized is we can use current systems with slight changes which allows landlords to not need to do background checks or worry about missing rent payments &amp;x200B; For DeFi depending on the platform you have to put up x coin and you can only borrow up to a y% of that So if it is a 80% platform then this means for every $100 you put up you can only borrow $80 &amp;x200B; With using this idea these smart contracts can be copy and modify a little to add a few features for renters The only person that puts up money is the renter And the required coin could be a stable coin So what happens is this 1 Landlord setups on the contract on some site saying how much it cost to rent the place and down deposit the type of coin like which stable coin lenh of time and the contract the person renting will signed 2 The renter will sign along with the landlord somehow signing it with their wallets That away joe blow that is not apart of the deal is not messing with things and it is hard attached to the 2 wallets 3 The renter will have to deposit the first month and down deposit down 4 Each payment period the renter must send the rent and the smart contract will look for this transaction If it does not see it then based on the settings the landlord gave the renter might lose their deposit automatically 5 At the end of the contract period like yearly when the landlord redoes the rent the landlord can update the contract on file the number and it starts back at 2 6 At the end of everything if the person meets the terms to get their deposit back then the landlord can release the deposit in to the renter is wallet This does 2 things The first is the landlord ca not do a surprise now your rent is double But this also makes it where they do not have to exactly worry about the renter not paying Even more since they can set the minimum deposit at something like 2 month is rent or whatever,HomeImprovement
27,A possibly dumb question I have been looking into buying crypto and as I have read up on all the options I noticed that most of the currencies do not seem to be primarily intended to be money but rather the money is an incentive for people to run the Blockchain so it can be used for other stuff Is this correct,CryptoTechnology
28,Can NFTs help with fractional real estate investing NFTs may be all the rage now but what most people associate it with at this point is digital art projects Given NFTs are relatively new I think digital art is a good start but there are much more things we should be able to use NFTs for For NFTs to go mainstream it will require mainstream use cases One such case I am considering is fractional real estate investing As someone in a blockchain sub you should be familiar with a decentralized autonomous organization DAO an organization represented by rules encoded in a computer program I think NFTs could be used for fractional real estate investing with LLCs run as DAOs purchasing physical real estate With the current legal system pooling funds to purchase real estate can be a hectic process but it could be made much easier with the blockchain Imagine you could buy NFTs that represent fractional shares of real estate properties and earn rental income from them In my opinion this can be achieved with NFTs and I think that is a use case various startups will get into as the NFT world progresses Already I have seen one such startup [Futurent] https: futurent io What do you think about my idea Can NFTs help with fractional real estate investing Yay or Nay,CryptoTechnology
29,What happens when new token is created and someone buy the tokens Let is say someone creates a new token and mint a million tokens This new token has no price yet Then all million tokens are put in a liquidity pool what will be the initial token price Does the owner have to specify the initial price When will the token price go up Will the price change automatically by the liquidity pool Does the owner have control over the price,CryptoTechnology
30,How do wallets actually interact with the blockchain How do nodes in a blockchain network understand a valid selling request from a wallet Another way of phrasing the question would be how does a wallet uniquely announce that it wants to make a transaction Is the private key utilized How does a wallet not give away too much info while announcing a transaction How are bad actors minimized here Can a hacker bad actor imitate a wallet Most nodes have an incentive to be accurate and they do not want to take in wrong malicious information so do nodes need to do any work to minimize bad requests Thanks for any info,CryptoTechnology
31,S O S PLEASE HELP Trust wallet I think I have been either scammed hacked or bought programmable coins that disappeared minutes after buying them Please help So I have two problems Very big problems I bought two coins on PancakeSwap and one shows only the balance of the second buy for like 5€ cause I thought my tokens are getting redirected after swapping cause they were not showing https: bscscan com token 0x8a1876c8f82cf4c23a13b33930973a9a9530676da=0x3c32d0bb7a79ae33153e49919dfde6f2547ccaa4 As you can see the balance is only 1 5k although I bought 115k an hour ago The 115k are not showing Second Problem is that this second coin is even showing up when adding a custom token on trust wallet and yes it is smart chain https: bscscan com tx 0xf6378780b07db14e1e4e8bf0cd5cafc854cd82808cadc77a268e792080c14b1c Please help did my coins get redirected Did I get scammed Please help someone explain please,HomeImprovement
32,How are crypto exchanges built I understand how a centralized crypto exchange functions in comparison to a DEX for instance However I am interested in understanding the architecture of a crypto exchange how it is built with what etc and especially the white-label solutions Some more specific questions: - Does the exchange operate some kind of a hot wallet that users buy from sell to - Does the exchange act as an intermediary between sellers and buyers and only gets involved to facilitate the transactions in case of insufficient liquidity - is a crypto exchange considered a web2 or a web3 app How much of the app actually utilizes blockchain I tried researching all the above but I only came across non-technical explanations of how an exchange works If you have any readings you can recommend I would highly appreciate it,CryptoTechnology

35,Reminder on downvoting wiki updates and community feedback on new type of video post requested Hi everyone Three topics for today’s announcement so let’s get right into it --- Downvoting etiquette Reddit’s official guidelines state that upvoting downvoting should be used as a measure of how much a comment contributes to the discussion and not as a like dislike button Of course we all know that our opinions of whether we dislike something and whether we think it’s a useful contribution often line up with each other However there has been an ongoing issue that we’d like to bring to your attention with this example slightly exaggerated scenario: OP posts asking for help OP says either in the original post or in a later comment something along the lines of “yeah so I got a 5 week old puppy from a Craigslist ad I met in a parking lot and I started using a prong collar on him the next day…” You are horrified and reflexively… downvote It can be really hard but we want to encourage you to either upvote to keep OP in neutral score or to not vote at all in these cases Please remember that OP came here for help and it’s important to show kindness and consideration for the reason they came to their current position based on their life experience and the knowledge they have had access to prior to this point Downvoting the OP and their followup comments to below 1 makes it more likely that their request will be missed and that people will be commenting without the complete set of information OP has provided; and that means it’s less likely that the OP will be supported in their quest for improvement --- So to recap: Comment providing advice to an OP or another commenter which breaches the subreddit rules - report and you can also downvote if you like Comment which is not rule-breaking advice but still poor quality e g recommending extinction procedures exclusively for a self-reinforcing behaviour instead of differential reinforcement of alternative behaviour - downvote if you like Thread or followup comment by OP which includes rule-breaking content as an explanation of what they’re doing and not advice to others - don’t downvote even if you really really want to No need to report either as we do want people to see the information to adjust their advice if needed Do not downvote questions generally If someone seems to be genuinely asking assume they are asking because they do not know and either respond or leave it Downvoting actual questions will not help the person asking learn to do better --- Similarly a reminder around being overly judgemental r doraining includes users from around the globe and hence there can be cultural clashes between users in terms of dog keeping and care Here are some common examples of extreme ranges in what is considered “normal”: The use of crates for confinement management of dogs ranges from widespread endorsement to being explicitly illegal in some circumstances Dogs are variably kept from always outdoors to partially out partially in to always indoors Dogs can regularly have applied to them nothing at all minimal objects like flat collars and bandanas moderate raincoats or boots all the way up to entire sets of doggy clothes and costumes It can be frustrating to talk to someone from a different background whose ideas about how dogs should live are so misaligned with yours that you consider their views ridiculous or abusive However if your goal is to change the other person’s mind you won’t get there through insulting them labelling them as cruel downvoting them and so on Aim to ground your comments in a fundamental review of the actual circumstances and discuss them in a reasoned way What are the dog’s genuine needs What evidence is there as to whether these needs are being met or not Is it as much of an issue as it appears at first glance What is the other person’s reasoning behind their current setup If it’s advised what options are there for adjustment of which there could be multiple other than your own personal expectations experience Remember the human on the other side of the screen and the kind of community we build here with each interaction Merely lashing out at the other person might temporarily make you feel better but isn’t valuable discussion and mods will exercise discretion in removing such comments as a result --- Wiki Updates We’ve been working in the background on expanding the wiki and if you haven’t seen it yet we have a new page on [veterinary care husbandry training] https: www reddit com r Doraining wiki husbandry Please check out the tutorials as this is an area of training that is often missed for many dogs and even a little bit of work can make your life in taking care of your pet a million times easier We’ve also significantly expanded our recommended book list and have been adding links to previous relevant threads in the subreddit as examples across multiple topics Of course some wiki articles were first drafted many years ago and as we all know the internet often doesn’t stay static So we’re doing a little crowdsourcing request here: ~~If you have time pick a random article in the wiki not already mentioned below and click every link inside it Let us know in a comment if all the links work correctly or if not tell us which links are broken Bonus points if you can find a new URL for the same resource or dredge it up using web-archive so we can slot it right in to fix~~ ALL COMPLETE Thank you so much to kyripka for helping out --- Video Reviews Behaviour Analysis We’ve had a lot of videos posted recently asking “are my dogs playing or not” or “what is my dog doing” We’ve worked to cut down on the number of generic non-problematic play videos coming up on the front page but we also want to start [a more in-depth video analysis program] https: www reddit com r Doraining comments pdcpyf trainers_behaviorists_replacement_for_donna_hills on a recurring basis This will be a good opportunity to practice your dog behaviour observation skills - we will be encouraging people to really tease apart individual components and include timestamps rather than just a simple overall assessment So [here’s a poll] https: forms gle 7vshDAAJGoaQnwir5 for you so that we can find your preferences on the format and frequency of these reviews Thanks and happy dog training The Doraining Mod Team,CryptoTechnology

37,When did you realize you had successfully trained your dog well Been training my almost 3 year old Alaskan Malamute to withhold from food unless given a release signal ever since she was a puppy she was a very naughty dog when it came to stealing food Well… I was preparing her raw meal right before I went to shower and cook some food and it had many treats in it that she LOVED she was whining as I was preparing her meal and couldn’t sit still I set her food right beside her while giving her the command to lie down and wait as usual I completely forgot to release her to eat Normally I give her the okay within a minute or walk away and come back and release her But I forgot- I went about my evening came back 30 minutes later to go hang up my towel and I found her drooling next to her bowl in the exact same position I left her I was so SHOCKED I always knew I had a good dog but holy… she really is a REALLY good dog I felt so proud but so bad at the time I gave her extra treats in her meal lol When was the moment you realized you trained your pup well,Dogtraining

44,How important is the do not greet your dog excitedly when you come home rule We sought out a lot of advice from trainers and experienced dog owners we first adopted our girl in 2020 One of the rules that came up often if not always was Make sure you do not make a big deal when you come home Well we are terrible at following that rule Whether we are gone for 2 hours or 2 minutes we basically throw a parade in her honor when we walk through the door She loves it And we love seeing her zoomies and booty wiggles lol For what it is worth she has no separation anxiety when we are gone we check on her through the doggy cam she has no problem being dropped off places like the vet or occasional daycare and she does not jump or get too excited when other people come over I only started wondering about this because a dog experienced friend of mine said You should not do that You should basically ignore her for a few minutes when you come home Is this just a training preference or are we doing something that may cause problems in the long run Thank you in advance for any advice,Dogtraining
45,Girlfriends dog pees on my bedroom carpet Ok so basically my girlfriend has 2 shihtzus one is 7 and the other is 8 Gf stays at mine twice a week and the dogs sleep with us in the bedroom I disagree with it at first but it’s how my girlfriend has brought them up and they’re pretty small so I don’t mind The oldest one has developed a habit of peeing on the carpet once she gets into the bedroom we ALWAYS walk them beforehand as they’re in a routine of walkies before bedtime so I have no idea why she has started doing this I know dogs keep their urine to mark territory could it just be her marking She just does it without a care in the world She doesn’t do this at my gfs house and is generally well trained Does anyone have any advice to get her to stop,Dogtraining
46,Doggo needs constant attention when boyfriend is over Hello everyone I have a little doggy pictured in the comments below who I have lived alone with almost his entire 6 year life We spend a ton of time together cuddling and hanging out I am almost always available to him since I started working from home 2 years ago I have started dating someone so he’s over frequently and Chief needs both of our attention on him at all times when he’s over Even if we’re standing and kiss he loses his mind he’s got a great beagle scream-bark he uses nonstop If we sit on the couch and our attention isn’t on him he will cry until my boyfriend pays attention to him This is only exacerbated if we go into a room and close the door He will sit outside and cry and paw at the door until we let him in I tried freezing some peanut butter baby food and cheese in a Kong and giving that to him when we closed the door That worked for a while but he eventually realized we were in another room and came to the door repeat performance I really would like for him to be more independent and confident when I’m not right there with him or he’s not part of an interaction I’m having with my boyfriend Any advice,family

60,I kinda feel dumped by mom am I being oversensitive Well i am a 22 male I live with my mom and 2 brothers we really are very close to eachother after my dad left us for like 10 years now So along the years I do not know if it is true or not but i feel like my mom prefers my older brother than me btw i am the middle bro When she has an argument with him and he may get angry and do some bad stuff like a couple of hours pass or even a day and they get good together again As for me If i litterally just get her a bit angry she shall not talk to me like for a weak or smt and act as it does not even matter for her too much stuff like this to say so i hope u understand what i want to say my main problem here is : my last birthday was in september when we all have summer vacation so we kinda have time to celebrate but what happened is not a single one of them did even remember my birthday and the day passed like any other day I remember only mom writing a 2 - lines post on fb so I was a bit mad and spoke to mom and told her how disappointed I am For my surprise she got mad at me and how i am so shallow and that they all have stuff to do and that my big brother is surely busy with his work and we are kinda grown ups and we DO NOT NEED to care about these stuff So on that love is in the heart and it does not have to be expressed well I got past it and did not make it a big deal today it is my big brother birthday I have exams from yesterday for like 1 month long in Medical faculty so I really am short in time and over stressed by studying But for my surprise mom woke up so early today and started setting up the house with decorations and gifts Then she started making a cake and ordered his favorite food So I told her that I am short in time and maybe we can delay it for tomorrow after my exam so I could have some time till the next exam but she answered that I still have a month to go and today is his birthday so it ca not be tomorrow I am a bit frustrated actually I am so disappointed and feel so dumped But maybe the circumstances differ Am I shallow or that really hurts to see you being neglected,family

64,When he couldn’t get his way he called himself a father…to the dog My toxic BIL and SIL discarded us after they didn’t get their visitation ‘rights’ with the birth of my son They call us narcissists because we wanted to bond with the baby in the hospital instead of having them bond with OUR baby everyday Immediately after our fight they blocked us on all social media AND changed their accounts to BILdogdad and SILdogmom They constantly refer to themselves now as ‘mom’ and ‘dad ’ While I understand that people refer to themselves as dog parents I find the timing odd and their behavior disturbing We had suspects they felt they were the parents of my so due yo some red flags that we ignored until this incident occurred Now many people believe that they are sick and thought the child was theirs in some respect Now they are complaining that we are ‘keeping their nephew’ away from them despite the fact they discarded us and refused to reconcile They send him gifts and cards and we just don’t respond They also constantly ask other family members about our son yet tell those same family members to not give us information about them we don’t ask We are now no contact with them and refuse to bring go our son to gatherings where they are present I am so tired of sick crazy people who think someone else’s child is theirs There are not enough mental institutions in the world for these sick people,family
65,I’m 30 female and a parent and realised my parents don’t love me or accept me for who I am but I don’t know why Is this weird I think my parents just felt obliged to say I love you If at all My mother wouldn’t say it and my father says love you at the end of all calls in a way that seems like he doesn’t mean it at all like he feels he has to Not to mention that he told me he never loved me when I was pregnant with my first child Why I was just a kid why couldn’t they love me,family
66,My sister blocked me Me and my sister had a few arguments over Christmas which ended in her blocking me on everything and not talking to me if we crossed paths In the past I did so many favours for her and when I asked for her to help me returning the favour she rejected it She blocked me then unblocked me after a day or so Next we had an argument She blocked me and hasn’t unblocked me or spoke to me since I thought she’d atleast be a bit human and unblock me on New Years but that wasn’t the case She still isn’t talking to me and I don’t want to beg to chat to her when I have my own family and am pregnant again She wants to be stubborn Is there any ways to get over her I haven’t blocked her on my end but now I’m thinking I should,family
67,My dad has changed and it is hard to stay close Advice I am a college student who is home for winter break I stay with my dad and we usually have a good relationship but the pandemic has changed him It is caused us to argue disagree about so many things and overall drive me away from him I am probably at fault too but my dad has changed a lot and literally everyone has noticed asks me if he is okay For example: He is very much against the vaccine to the point where he makes himself the victim for example he seems to think the side effects of the vaccine are worse than people dying from the virus I can respect people is decisions even if I disagree with them but he will talk about it for HOURS every day and I believe that he has some wrong over-exaggerated information He is also into health a lot but specifically how much he hates doctors and how natural remedies oils supplements etc are the way to go I do think that they are important but again he talks about it ALL THE TIME He also complains about how my sisters and I do not follow his health advice so we must be lazy and not care about our health But at this point I am way too busy to follow all his advice and I do not even want to when it is all I hear about all day every day I feel bad saying that He almost favors me and my youngest sister P over our other sister B He takes our mental health seriously but has apparently disregarded B is cries for help It sickens me how he talks about her sometimes Yes she is not the perfect person but none of us are She does not deserve the backlash my dad gives her Some of it maybe but definitely not most of it And finally he dumps his emotional baggage on me I phrase it that way because that is how it feels He talks about everything that upsets him and one big one is my sisters They are older now 15 &amp; 18 and spend most of their time with their friends They usually come over on the weekends since they live with our mom during the week But he will constantly complain about how they do not share anything with him But here is why whenever we confide in him he reacts the same way: he says stop crying and then goes on to lecture us on how to feel better We do not want that we want comfort But he does not understand how to do that and we have told him multiple times but nothing has changed So my sisters have stopped telling him personal things which makes sense But he will constantly mope about it to me and makes it about him Like why do they treat me this way Why do they tell your mom more than they tell me I am not the bad guy stuff like that It irks me but especially stresses me out because I DONT WANT TO HEAR THAT STUFF It almost feels like I am his therapist sometimes I completely shut off when this happens and I hate it Part of me thinks he just needs someone to talk to But another part of me thinks: I am literally his daughter he should not be talking about this with me So yeah I would love some advice I have intense guilt issues so this is weighing on me a lot Am I overreacting and being too sensitive Am I reasonable in not wanting to spend time with him anymore I do not know what to do TL;DR: My dad only talks about certain topics that stress me out and vents to me about his mental health I ca not handle it anymore but am I just overreacting,family
68,How to help my brother open up Recently our father passed away My family never had a close relationship with our father to put it mildly My brother for the first time in his life expressed to me how unhappy he was with himself He like our father never showed vulnerability and the only emotions he usually showed other than joy happiness were frustration anger or other negative feelings He told me that he was worried he has become like our father and hates himself for it He is also worried he will eventually be alienated from his kids due to his behavior I was never comfortable to bring this up with my brother in the past since he is short-tempered and always cut short any conversations related to self-improvement he is sensitive and viewed anything directed towards him as a personal attack However with our father is passing my brother opened up to me and I want to make sure I can help him since he is aware of his behavior and seems to want to change I am looking for ideas on how to help him He is currently adamantly against seeing a therapist I am trying some things and have talked with my SIL but I do not want to expose too much detail in this post in case he sees this I am trying to help him see that he can change that it is worth the effort in order to have better view of himself and to develop a stronger relationship with his kids and ways in which he can be happier he is full of stress Any suggestions would be appreciated TL;DR Brother who usually does not talk openly has opened up to me trying to figure out how best to connect to him to help him,family
69,How much can you really communicate with Mum Aunt her sister So I kinda need advice on this some context: My mum is a big hoarder and she likes to buy new things but never throw out anything old My house has become so cluttered to a point where I feel frustrated upset and embarrassed about my home living situation I never dared to invite friends home because of how messy dirty and dusty it is I have tried to tell and talk to my mum about keeping things neat and throwing away things she does not need But she is the kind who thinks that everything is important and everything needs to be kept I tried cleaning some areas of the house but she somehow manages to clutter it pretty soon after the clean up And every single time I bring up this cleaning conversation she shuts me down with a You do not need to care about what I am doing Just leave me alone My dad and brother who is tried to help a few years ago is also over helping her as when they tried to clean up the apartment it somehow ended in a cold war as she does not like people touching her things I have described and talked to her so many times how it is affecting me and how the living situation is making me frustrated and unhappy which she always seems to listen but never takes any action Spoke to her sister she is 64 recently about this and her sister thinks there is still that filial piety we have to fulfill considering she is my mum and all we need to do is talk to her nicely She seems to have this ideal that as long as we take the time to talk things with my mum she will listen But the thing is we mainly me have spoken to her more than 10 times about cleaning up and yet she shuts me down every single time I have resorted to moving to my aunt is house dad is sister so i avoid less head butting with my mum but her sister thinks that I ca not avoid this problem forever and should hash it out The question is: 1 How much can I really communicate with my mum such that she considers my point of view 2 How do I tell her sister that it is honestly futile effort and it is just so difficult to change someone especially when it is my mother she is 62 3 Do I really not avoid this problem and just keep butting heads with my mum which may even strain our relationship : Thanks for your help in advance,family

72,I bought a Ryobi Drill and Driver set and can NOT recommend it A few weeks ago I asked for recommendations here for a drill and driver set I ended up going with this Ryobi One + HP set : https: www homedepot com p RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-Compact-1-2-in-Drill-and-Impact-Driver-Kit-with-2-1-5-Ah-Batteries-Charger-and-Bag-PSBCK01K 313438682 I used it a few weeks on a few small honey-do projects and also removing deck stairs lots of fasteners I’m not a fan and will be returning it and will look at Dewalt or Bosch as a replacement for my current 10+ year old Bosch set Pros: The main reason I chose Ryobi was because they are inexpensive and use the same battery for a lot of their other line of tools I’m just a homeowner diy’er and didn’t feel the need to spend the money on what a pro contractor would use e g Milwaukee Cons quirks : They just feel cheap compared to my Bosch set and my neighbors Dewalt set Cheap plastic not solid feeling etc They sound like a toy with a high pitched whine again compared to the Bosch and Dewalt set Now for my real issues with them: the chuck on the impact is already acting up The spring loaded mechanism doesn’t always work so I have to pull on the chuck to insert a bit nearly 90% of the time It’s only 3 weeks old… The trigger doesn’t activate on the first pull 20% of the time but will on the subsequent second pull of the trigger The impact action seems louder and more ear piercing maybe it’s just higher pitched but I used ear plugs for comfort when I never felt the need to with my Bosch It’s too bad because Ryobi seems to have a great line of inexpensive tools that I was planning to buy that are compatible with these batteries Dewalt also has compatible battery tools but tend to be at least 30% more expensive than the Ryobi equivalents Anyone else share these feelings about Ryobi Maybe I got the batch that was built on a Friday afternoon…,HomeImprovement
73,I feel like I am being discriminated against for being poor I apologize if this is not the right sub but hear me out I have been trying to obtain quotes for various projects to account for budgeting next year I have done a ton of work to this house myself but some things are out of my wheelhouse or involve work I am not good at like drywall mud and overhead work Once I give a place my address they suddenly seem less interested in coming out I live in an older lower income part of town I needed a quote to drywall my kitchen and hallway ceiling and had a drywall company come out I noticed they did not even take measurements and said they would email me a quote within a week Two weeks pass and I call and leave a message A week later without reply I text them and I saw it had been read but no reply It is been extremely depressing because if I drive by the more affluent parts of town I see all kinds of work being done But anymore it seems like money pretty much dictates everything in life I need to put new wall cabinets up next year sometime but ca not do so until the ceiling is fixed A lot of projects I can do myself are layered I can do A and B but until I have C done by another company I ca not do anything but sit and stare and grow frustrated Ghosting seems so damn common anymore If your backed up or simply not interested in the job then tell me,family
74,Muriatic acid damage in basement renovation Hi all I have been renovating the basement in a house I recently purchased The basement did have existing walls but needed significant upgrades which I have been doing myself over the past few months I have been nearing completion getting down to paint and finishes and a little patching in the slab I hired a crew to do some drywall work and remove the peeling paint that had previously been applied to the slab floor and apply an epoxy paint and topcoat Originally we had discussed grinding the painted floor but halfway through the job post drywall pre painting the owner’s son took over the project He said they wanted to try using an acid to loosen the paint and then scrape it off He said they would test it first and work in sections I went away for six days to visit family over Christmas and gave them access to the lower level to work while I was away When I returned I found they had applied muriatic acid to the entirety of the floors 800+ sq ft and not returned All windows and exterior doors were closed and they had a fan running I’m not sure how long it had been sitting They did not return the first day I was back and only came out the second day after repeated phone calls The damage is pretty extensive and I’m not sure the remedy or how to proceed here The running fan and enclosed space led to me having a coating of muriatic acid on everything It’s on the walls and ceiling corroding my exposed plumbing in the bathroom I had spent significant time renovating I didn’t have faceplates on a number of switches outlets and junction boxes and all exposed wiring and terminals are corroded my water main as well I had recently installed mini splits and one is fried and I assume the other is damaged Yesterday when they came back I had them apply a baking soda solution to the floor to neutralize the acid The son was apologetic and admitted fault and said he wasn’t aware that the acid had been applied and left He agreed to replace the mini splits if my HVAC guy deemed necessary At that time I hadn’t noticed the other damage to the electric and plumbing Two rooms I had planned to paint but now the third is required as well The textured popcorn ceiling I’m assuming is saturated which I had planned to leave but now would rather have scraped and painted So I’m here wondering if anyone can say the extent of the damage to the wiring and plumbing and what the best course of action here is He’s made it clear he accepts responsibility and wants to fix it but also that was before I thought an electrician and plumber should be involved Try to work it out with them or hire out the repairs including finishing the painting Get a GC in here to deal with it all Unfortunately I’m leaving again in two days for a week and won’t be able to get anyone in in that time The painting company has been in business a long time in the area and is highly reviewed and insured I planned to post pictures of the damage but realized you can’t in this community The exposed wires all have green oxidation as well as my exposed plumbing Thanks,HomeImprovement

114,[D] What are the recent breakthroughs for the generative models for art Hey everyone I am interested in the recent developments or models in the area of Neural Style Transfer I am also interested in other applications in art not only Neural Style Transfer so feel free to point those as well What are the mostly used models in this area nowadays Can you point me to the papers Thanks a lot,MachineLearning
115,[D] Machine learning alternative to MCMC or Nested Sampling For work I am regularly in the position of having to fit complex models to datasets For the most part it involves defining some kind of likelihood function merit function that uses a certain set of parameters to find the distance between a model and data Currently the standard methods for this in my field are usually MCMC and their variants and Nested Sampling MCMCs and NS are a robust and safe way to find the global minimum maximun but in high-dimensional parameter spaces they become very slow I am right now running a possibly month long NS chain just for an exploratory test in a 32 cores PC While a month-long run could be OK-ish for a definitive result it is not feasible for exploratory exercises I really ca not do one each time I tweak a thing Is there any fast efficient alternative to MCMC or Nested sampling out there Something that while might not be as safe as Nested Sampling could give me a good estimate of the best set of parameters in a significantly shorter run,MachineLearning
