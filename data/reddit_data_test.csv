Hello, all. During the month of January, the sub book club will be reading **Shades of Grey** by Jasper Fforde. Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Jasper himself will be joining us for an AMA.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2113260.Shades_of_Grey) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

&gt;*Shades of Grey* tells of a battle against overwhelming odds. In a society where the ability to see the higher end of the color spectrum denotes a better social standing, Eddie Russet belongs to the low-level House of Red and can see his own color—but no other. The sky, the grass, and everything in between are all just shades of grey, and must be colorized by artificial means.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eddie's world wasn't always like this. There's evidence of a never-discussed disaster and now, many years later, technology is poor, news sporadic, the notion of change abhorrent, and nighttime is terrifying: no one can see in the dark. Everyone abides by a bizarre regime of rules and regulations, a system of merits and demerits, where punishment can result in permanent expulsion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eddie, who works for the Color Control Agency, might well have lived out his rose-tinted life without a hitch. But that changes when he becomes smitten with Jane, a Grey, which is low-caste in this color-centric world. She shows Eddie that all is not well with the world he thinks is just and good. Together, they engage in dangerous revolutionary talk.

2,books,Reading considered disrespectful/rude - using your phone totaly fine,"This christmas I was invited to the family of my step mother, one evening hosted by her mother, the other by her daughter. For both occations I brought books since sleeping over was basically forced on me. After Christmas dinner, all of them started talking while staying on their phones for 90% of the time, none of the topics were especially interesting or difficult to follow, but nonetheless they didn't manage to really discuss anything and seemed to only try to responed in the least demanding way. So I decided to get my book (reread of True Grit by Charles Portis), since I can manage better conversation while reading than they can muster while on their phones and just couldn't cope doing nothing but listening to this farce. When I sat down to read my father started berating me how rude and disrespectful I am to the host and the other people talking at the table with my stepmother also chiming in and supporting the view of my father. I excused myself for the evening and went to sleep early. The next day after dinner they were discussing how I had to work on my social skills and behaviour unless I want to upset people in the future.

When did mindnumbing phone use get socially more accepted than reading a book?

4,books,Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago,"So I'm reading *Discworld* for the first time (yes I know, quite late to the party on this), enjoying it so far, but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor. I thought I'd share it here because it shows that this kind of thing has been prevalent in fantasy (and to be fair, many other kinds of) literature for a long time now.

From *The Light Fantastic* (I don't think this counts as a spoiler since it doesn't give away any of the plot, mods please let me know if I'm wrong):

&gt; ...this particular hero was a heroine. A redheaded one.

&gt; Now, there is a tendency at a point like this to look over one's shoulder at the cover artist and start going on at length about leather, thighboots and naked blades.

&gt; Words like ""full,"" ""round"" and even ""pert"" creep into the narrative, until the writer has to go and have a cold shower and a lie down.

&gt; Which is all rather silly, because any woman setting out to make a living by the sword isn't about to go around looking like something off the cover of the more advanced kind of lingerie catalogue for the specialized buyer.

And then Pratchett does communicate that this character is attractive, but he does so almost grudgingly, as though it's some kind of concession to the reader:

&gt; Oh well, all right. The point that must be made is that although Herrena the Henna-Haired Harridan would look quite stunning after a good bath, a heavy-duty manicure, and the pick of the leather racks in Woo Hun Ling's Oriental Exotica and Martial Aids on Heroes Street, she was currently quite sensibly dressed in light chainmail, soft boots and a short sword.

&gt; All right, maybe the boots were leather. But not black.

This book was published in 1986, so this was an interesting (and funny) glimpse into the fact that the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy (which still persists today) has been around for a long time.","Sir Terry Pratchett was making fun of the hyper-sexualization of female characters in fantasy literature 35 years ago So I'm reading *Discworld* for the first time (yes I know, quite late to the party on this), enjoying it so far, but one particular passage stood out to me because it so expertly called out the unfortunate tendency of fantasy authors to overly sexualize female characters using some very clever wit and humor.

I mainly read classics, non-fiction and philosophy. I love reading, but it’s disappointing to find out that I’m not able to talk about books I’ve read, because I can’t remember ideas or the plot.

6,books,Quick thought about the Trafalmadorians of Slaughterhouse 5,"So here's a thought I just had

When Vonnegut published slaughterhouse 5, readers only had access to books and stories through paper. And therefore they only interacted with books with their eyes and hands. We also know that Trafalmadorians are creatures that mainly feature an eye and a hand.  


We, as readers, also see a book's tale as an ensemble more than a page-to-page or moment-to-moment action. We can freely see what happenned before and what will happen whenever we want, we are, unstuck in the narration. Just as the trafalmadorians?  


Finally, the zoo. Whenever as a group of readers or consumers of any media we experience a story, the characters are put in a mental zoo of sorts as we can tune in or out of the zoo whenever we want and the characters will still be there.  


So my point is, could the aliens featured in Vonnegut's book be taken as a metaphor for the reader?

7,books,The Silmarillion is the most important book in Tolkien's canon and nothing less than a work of art,"A couple years ago, I bought a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien's transcription of the story of Kullervo, a very prominent figure in the Kalevala, a compilation of Finnish folklore and mythology akin to the Four Ancient Books of Wales and the Cycles of Irish mythology.

In this book, a foreword was written by the editor, Verlyn Flieger, which expounded on Tolkien's admiration of the Kalevala and what it meant to the Finnish—for the Kalevala was compiled and publicized at a time when Finland was occupied by Russia and Finnish culture was being suppressed to encourage obeisance. The Kalevala became something like a rallying cry for the Finnish, galvanizing their revolution against their oppressors, and contributed to the eventual revolution that saw Finland declaring independence from Russia in 1917.

According to Flieger, this level of national and cultural pride deeply affected Tolkien. It was the man's ambition, allegedly, to create a mythology that was wholly British, wholly for his home country, for he knew as a linguist and philologist that most British tales had in fact come from somewhere else—King Arthur absconded from Cymry/Wales, for example, by the Anglo-Saxons.

And this is why the Silmarillion, specifically, is the most important of all of Tolkien's works: it encapsulates the spirit of why he created Middle-earth in the first place.

The Silmarillion, like much of Tolkien's work, is difficult to read for many — it's as dry as a textbook, they say. And that's because *it is* *essentially a textbook.* Like the Kalevala that inspired Tolkien so greatly, the Silmarillion was an entirely fictional compilation of all the stories Tolkien had envisioned for his world, inspired and invigorated by Tolkien's passion for his work and his nation. If you read the Silmarillion, you can see just how deeply the man cared for his world and the stories he had to tell—how *passionate* he was for a place that didn't exist but for in his mind, and now, the minds of all who read his work.

The Silmarillion embodies the spirit of Middle-earth, the reason for its existence, more completely than *The Hobbit* or *The Lord of the Rings* could ever hope to do. It's a well-known story by now, but Middle-earth was invented so the languages Tolkien was creating would have a home; and in a similar fashion, I believe *The Hobbit* and LOTR were created so the Silmarillion could be published, as Tolkien's truest labor of love.","The Silmarillion is the most important book in Tolkien's canon and nothing less than a work of art A couple years ago, I bought a copy of J.R.R.

8,books,We by Yevgeni Zamyatin vs. 1984 by George Orwell,"I’ve just finisher reading We. I read 1974 a couple of months ago, and I enjoyed it, but I figured I should read the novel that Orwell modeled 1984 on as well. Now look, I wasn’t surprised that 1984 was similar to We, after all, Orwell admitted taking inspiration from Zamyatin. What I was surpriser by was, however, how similar the plot was. Two novels that criticise totalitarianism are bound to be similar in one way or another, but I feel like Orwell just plain ripped off the story. It became clear 20 pages into reading We, and by the end of the novel it got quite absurd. 


With that out of the way, I must also admit that We seems like the superior work in absolutely every single aspect. The prose is a lot more complex and nuanced, the political critique is not so obvious and direct (I found it really subtle and even humorous at times), the whole plot, however similar, is a lot better paced, and there is no point in the book where I felt it dragged without much purpose. Orwell seemed to be very motivated to beat the reader over the head with the same idea for too many pages at a time, which is something you don’t feel while reading We.


What are your thoughts? I still have a fond opinion on 1984, but We is the better work of art, by an obviously more capable writer when it comes to fiction. I know Orwell was a good journalist, and an outstanding political thinker.","We by Yevgeni Zamyatin vs. 1984 by George Orwell I’ve just finisher reading We.

9,books,What are some tropes you'd like to see more often in books?,"They can be related to the characters, the storyline, relationships ect.

I've seen quite a few people talking about overrated tropes they dislike, so I think it'd be interesting to hear what people would like to read about instead.

So, what are some tropes you think deserve more appreciation?

Some of mine are:

* (Main) characters who don't end up with each other when there is romance involved in the book
* Friends to Lovers
* Friends with benefits-relationships
* Morally grey protagonists  


Side note: I'm not sure if ""morally grey"" is the right term for it, but by it I mean characters who think they're doing the right thing, but in reality it causes harm for others. Not the type of jerks who think of themselves as better than others and treat the people around them badly on purpose.","What are some tropes you'd like to see more often in books?

10,books,I just finished Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry (RIP) *SPOILERS*,"I know this book has been discussed, but not in about six months so far as I can tell. “There are many like it, but this one is mine” I guess. 

It took a long time, about 400 pages for me to get sucked in to this book. McMurtry was a 3000 words a day guy, and I think that contributes to the sprawl of this book. I think he probably drove his editors crazy, but even in 1986 his stature may have been too great for him to be bullied into culling the word count. I don’t think it suffers for it, but people might be liable to give up before it gets really good. 

To me, this book is proof that character is the most important element of story telling, and that plot is irrelevant. This book is not about a cattle drive to Montana. That’s just the canvas. The brush strokes are about unrequited love. Dish loves Lorena, Gus loves Clara, Newt wants to be loved by Call. 

It is also about how the lives we lead are rarely deliberate. Clara marries Bob for dubious reasons because she doesn’t want to be challenged as an equal, she wants to be the alpha. Call goes North because he’s bored. Gus goes because of Clara and because he can’t leave Call. Deets and Pea go out of attachment to Gus and Call. The rest go because they need money. It’s the doom of them all, and why? Not one person sits down and interrogates their reasoning for the lives they lead. And how many of us do?

Perhaps I’ve missed a few but these are the chief themes I picked up. I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe McMurtry belongs with Cormac McCarthy as the greatest authors about the American West.

If you enjoyed this type of book, I can’t recommend Shogun by James Clavell enough.","I just finished Lonesome Dove by Larry McMurtry (RIP) *SPOILERS* I know this book has been discussed, but not in about six months so far as I can tell. “There are many like it, but this one is mine” I guess.

24,CryptoTechnology,"/r/CryptoTechnology now only allows text submissions - no images, videos or links.","Hi folks!

Based on [feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/9gon8f/what_can_we_do_better_rcryptotechnology/) (thank you, by the way!) and based on our own internal discussions, we've decided to only allow text submissions to our subreddit. This will inevitably reduce the amount of posts we receive, but it will provide *higher quality* technology focused discussions that belong here. We've done this as it's *almost impossible* for us to differentiate what blog posts and links are submitted in an attempt to shill and which ones are an attempt to provoke thoughtful technical discussion.

For example, anyone can post a link to a new coin or shill blog and simply say ""I want a technical discussion!"".

We do realize that certain blog posts may invoke great technical discussion revolving around announcements, new coins, and so on, and for those we ask that you link the post in your text submission but also:

1. Provide some context around the link, what's interesting about it?
2. Provide a short summary of what the blog has written about.
3. Provide thought-provoking technical analysis over the post.
4. Ask proper or provoking questions about the technology.

Example of what *wouldn't* be okay for a text post that revolves around a blog link:

&gt;title: ""x coin has released new tech called xblockchain!""  
&gt;  
&gt;text inside: ""what do you guys think?"" or ""what's this?""

Example of what *would* be okay:

&gt;title: ""x coin has released new tech called xblockchain!""  
&gt;  
&gt;text inside: ""it looks like x coin finally released xblockchain which is supposed to do xthing and xthing! This would change the xindustry because currently we're lacking proper feeless transaction history collaboration. I am a bit confused about the xart technology because in order for it to seamlessly integrate they'd have to... what do you guys think?""

Now we're not saying you need to be an expert in blockchain technology or that you need to understand everything you're talking about or reading about, but simply put effort into any text post that revolves around a blog post as to make sure it provokes technical discussion. We're not /r/CryptoBlogPosts, /r/CryptoNews or /r/CryptoSubmitALinkAndLeave.

Put effort into it and we'll likely approve and keep the post on our subreddit. We'll remove any submissions that we deem not thought provoking or technical enough, or worse: low effort.

As for normal text submissions, try to stay on-point and technical. Follow our rules:

1. No shilling, spamming, manipulation.
2. No memes, low quality posts, low effort posts.
3. No pricing discussion, no prediction posts.

You get the drill.

In a nutshell, we want to provide quality content revolving around technical discussions for cryptocurrency / blockchain technology. We want to be the place where folks can come to avoid shilling, spam, hodling, pricing, predictions, recommendations, fomo-ing, and so on. The only content you should see here is users participating in pure technical discussions revolving around coins and their real-world use, something you simply can't find anywhere else.

A vision like this requires intense scrutiny and moderation, so please be patient if your post was flagged, we'll review it as soon as possible. Shoot over a message to our mods if it's been longer than 12 hours.

Cheers everyone, looking forward to your submissions!","/r/CryptoTechnology now only allows text submissions - no images, videos or links. Hi folks!

26,CryptoTechnology,IDEA: Using smart contracts to rent apartments or other things,"So I was thinking about how we can get away from the credit score system, and something I think I realized is we can use current systems with slight changes which allows landlords to not need to do background checks or worry about missing rent payments.

&amp;#x200B;

For DeFi depending on the platform you have to put up x coin and you can only borrow up to a y% of that. So if it's a 80% platform then this means for every $100 you put up you can only borrow $80. 

&amp;#x200B;

With using this idea these smart contracts can be copy and modify a little to add a few features for renters. The only person that puts up money is the renter. And the required coin could be a stable coin. So what happens is this.

1. Landlord setups on the contract on some site saying how much it cost to rent the place and down deposit, the type of coin (like which stable coin), length of time, and the contract the person renting will signed.
2. The renter will sign along with the landlord somehow signing it with their wallets. That away joe blow that isn't apart of the deal isn't messing with things, and it is hard attached to the 2 wallets.
3. The renter will have to deposit the first month and down deposit down.
4. Each payment period the renter must send the rent and the smart contract will look for this transaction. If it doesn't see it then based on the settings the landlord gave the renter might lose their deposit automatically. 
5. At the end of the contract period (like yearly when the landlord redoes the rent) the landlord can update the contract on file, the number, and it starts back at 2.
6. At the end of everything, if the person meets the terms to get their deposit back then the landlord can release the deposit in to the renter's wallet.

This does 2 things. The first is the landlord can't do a surprise now your rent is double. But this also makes it where they don't have to exactly worry about the renter not paying. Even more since they can set the minimum deposit at something like 2 month's rent or whatever.","IDEA: Using smart contracts to rent apartments or other things So I was thinking about how we can get away from the credit score system, and something I think I realized is we can use current systems with slight changes which allows landlords to not need to do background checks or worry about missing rent payments.

28,CryptoTechnology,Can NFTs help with fractional real estate investing?," NFTs may be all the rage now, but what most people associate it with at this point is digital art projects. Given NFTs are relatively new, I think digital art is a good start, but there are much more things we should be able to use NFTs for. For NFTs to go mainstream, it'll require mainstream use cases. One such case I'm considering is fractional real estate investing.  

As someone in a blockchain sub, you should be familiar with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), an organization represented by rules encoded in a computer program. I think NFTs could be used for fractional real estate investing, with LLCs run as DAOs purchasing physical real estate. With the current legal system, pooling funds to purchase real estate can be a hectic process, but it could be made much easier with the blockchain.  

Imagine you could buy NFTs that represent fractional shares of real estate properties, and earn rental income from them. In my opinion, this can be achieved with NFTs and I think that's a use case various startups will get into as the NFT world progresses. Already, I've seen one such startup, [Futurent](https://futurent.io/).  

What do you think about my idea? Can NFTs help with fractional real estate investing? Yay or Nay?","Can NFTs help with fractional real estate investing?

- Does the exchange act as an intermediary between sellers and buyers and only gets involved to facilitate the transactions in case of insufficient liquidity?

- is a crypto exchange considered a web2 or a web3 app? How much of the app actually utilizes blockchain?

35,Dogtraining,"Reminder on downvoting, wiki updates, and community feedback on new type of video post requested.","Hi everyone,

Three topics for today’s announcement, so let’s get right into it.

---

## Downvoting etiquette

Reddit’s official guidelines state that upvoting/downvoting should be used as a measure of *how much a comment contributes to the discussion* and not as a like/dislike button. Of course, we all know that our opinions of whether we dislike something and whether we think it’s a useful contribution often line up with each other. However, there has been an ongoing issue that we’d like to bring to your attention with this example (slightly exaggerated) scenario:

* OP posts asking for help  
* OP says, either in the original post or in a later comment, something along the lines of “yeah, so I got a 5 week old puppy from a Craigslist ad I met in a parking lot, and I started using a prong collar on him the next day…”  
* You are horrified, and reflexively… downvote?  

It can be really hard, but we want to encourage you to either upvote to keep OP in neutral score, or to not vote at all, in these cases. Please remember that OP came here for help, and it’s important to show kindness and consideration for the reason they came to their current position based on their life experience and the knowledge they have had access to prior to this point. Downvoting the OP and their followup comments to below 1 makes it more likely that their request will be missed, and that people will be commenting without the complete set of information OP has provided; and that means it’s less likely that the OP will be supported in their quest for improvement. 

---

So, to recap:  

* Comment providing *advice* to an OP or another commenter which breaches the subreddit rules -&gt; report, and you can also downvote if you like   
* Comment which is not rule-breaking advice, but still poor quality (e.g. recommending extinction procedures exclusively for a self-reinforcing behaviour instead of differential reinforcement of alternative behaviour) -&gt; downvote if you like  
* Thread or followup comment by OP, which includes rule-breaking content as an *explanation* of what they’re doing and not advice to others -&gt; don’t downvote even if you really really want to. No need to report either, as we do want people to see the information to adjust their advice if needed.  
* Don't downvote questions generally. If someone seems to be genuinely asking, assume they're asking because they don't know and either respond, or leave it. Downvoting actual questions will not help the person asking learn to do better.  

---

Similarly, a reminder around being overly judgemental. r/dogtraining includes users from around the globe, and hence there can be cultural clashes between users in terms of dog *keeping* and *care*. Here are some common examples of extreme ranges in what is considered “normal”:  

* The use of crates for confinement management of dogs ranges from widespread endorsement to being explicitly illegal in some circumstances  
* Dogs are variably kept from always outdoors to partially out/partially in to always indoors  
* Dogs can regularly have applied to them nothing at all, minimal objects like flat collars and bandanas, moderate raincoats or boots, all the way up to entire sets of doggy clothes and costumes  

It can be frustrating to talk to someone from a different background whose ideas about how dogs should live are so misaligned with yours that you consider their views ridiculous or abusive. However, if your goal is to change the other person’s mind, you won’t get there through insulting them, labelling them as cruel, downvoting them and so on. Aim to ground your comments in a fundamental review of the actual circumstances, and discuss them in a reasoned way. What are the dog’s genuine needs? What evidence is there as to whether these needs are being met, or not? Is it as much of an issue as it appears at first glance? What is the other person’s reasoning behind their current setup? If it’s advised, what options are there for adjustment, of which there could be multiple *other* than your own personal expectations/experience? Remember the human on the other side of the screen, and the kind of community we build here with each interaction. Merely lashing out at the other person might temporarily make you feel better, but isn’t valuable discussion and mods will exercise discretion in removing such comments as a result. 

---

## Wiki Updates

We’ve been working in the background on expanding the wiki, and if you haven’t seen it yet we have a new page on [veterinary care/husbandry training](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/husbandry). Please check out the tutorials, as this is an area of training that is often missed for many dogs and even a little bit of work can make your life in taking care of your pet a million times easier. We’ve also significantly expanded our recommended book list, and have been adding links to previous relevant threads in the subreddit as examples across multiple topics. 

Of course, some wiki articles were first drafted many years ago, and as we all know the internet often doesn’t stay static. So we’re doing a little crowdsourcing request here: 

~~If you have time, pick a random article in the wiki not already mentioned below, and click every link inside it. Let us know in a comment if all the links work correctly, or if not, tell us which links are broken. Bonus points if you can find a new URL for the same resource, or dredge it up using web-archive, so we can slot it right in to fix!~~

ALL COMPLETE! Thank you so much to kyripka for helping out!

## Video Reviews/Behaviour Analysis

We’ve had a lot of videos posted recently asking “are my dogs playing or not?” or “what is my dog doing?” We’ve worked to cut down on the number of generic non-problematic play videos coming up on the front page, but we also want to start [a more in-depth video analysis program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pdcpyf/trainers_behaviorists_replacement_for_donna_hills/) on a recurring basis. This will be a good opportunity to practice your dog behaviour observation skills - we will be encouraging people to really tease apart individual components and include timestamps, rather than just a simple overall assessment. So [here’s a poll](https://forms.gle/7vshDAAJGoaQnwir5) for you so that we can find your preferences on the format and frequency of these reviews!

It can be really hard, but we want to encourage you to either upvote to keep OP in neutral score, or to not vote at all, in these cases. Please remember that OP came here for help, and it’s important to show kindness and consideration for the reason they came to their current position based on their life experience and the knowledge they have had access to prior to this point. Downvoting the OP and their followup comments to below 1 makes it more likely that their request will be missed, and that people will be commenting without the complete set of information OP has provided; and that means it’s less likely that the OP will be supported in their quest for improvement. 

---

So, to recap:  

* Comment providing *advice* to an OP or another commenter which breaches the subreddit rules -&gt; report, and you can also downvote if you like   
* Comment which is not rule-breaking advice, but still poor quality (e.g. recommending extinction procedures exclusively for a self-reinforcing behaviour instead of differential reinforcement of alternative behaviour) -&gt; downvote if you like  
* Thread or followup comment by OP, which includes rule-breaking content as an *explanation* of what they’re doing and not advice to others -&gt; don’t downvote even if you really really want to. No need to report either, as we do want people to see the information to adjust their advice if needed.  
* Don't downvote questions generally. If someone seems to be genuinely asking, assume they're asking because they don't know and either respond, or leave it. Downvoting actual questions will not help the person asking learn to do better.  

---

Similarly, a reminder around being overly judgemental. r/dogtraining includes users from around the globe, and hence there can be cultural clashes between users in terms of dog *keeping* and *care*. Here are some common examples of extreme ranges in what is considered “normal”:  

* The use of crates for confinement management of dogs ranges from widespread endorsement to being explicitly illegal in some circumstances  
* Dogs are variably kept from always outdoors to partially out/partially in to always indoors  
* Dogs can regularly have applied to them nothing at all, minimal objects like flat collars and bandanas, moderate raincoats or boots, all the way up to entire sets of doggy clothes and costumes  

It can be frustrating to talk to someone from a different background whose ideas about how dogs should live are so misaligned with yours that you consider their views ridiculous or abusive. However, if your goal is to change the other person’s mind, you won’t get there through insulting them, labelling them as cruel, downvoting them and so on. Aim to ground your comments in a fundamental review of the actual circumstances, and discuss them in a reasoned way. What are the dog’s genuine needs? What evidence is there as to whether these needs are being met, or not? Is it as much of an issue as it appears at first glance? What is the other person’s reasoning behind their current setup? If it’s advised, what options are there for adjustment, of which there could be multiple *other* than your own personal expectations/experience? Remember the human on the other side of the screen, and the kind of community we build here with each interaction. Merely lashing out at the other person might temporarily make you feel better, but isn’t valuable discussion and mods will exercise discretion in removing such comments as a result.

## Wiki Updates

We’ve been working in the background on expanding the wiki, and if you haven’t seen it yet we have a new page on [veterinary care/husbandry training](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/husbandry). Please check out the tutorials, as this is an area of training that is often missed for many dogs and even a little bit of work can make your life in taking care of your pet a million times easier. We’ve also significantly expanded our recommended book list, and have been adding links to previous relevant threads in the subreddit as examples across multiple topics. 

Of course, some wiki articles were first drafted many years ago, and as we all know the internet often doesn’t stay static. So we’re doing a little crowdsourcing request here: 

~~If you have time, pick a random article in the wiki not already mentioned below, and click every link inside it. Let us know in a comment if all the links work correctly, or if not, tell us which links are broken. Bonus points if you can find a new URL for the same resource, or dredge it up using web-archive, so we can slot it right in to fix!~~

ALL COMPLETE! Thank you so much to kyripka for helping out!

## Video Reviews/Behaviour Analysis

We’ve had a lot of videos posted recently asking “are my dogs playing or not?” or “what is my dog doing?” We’ve worked to cut down on the number of generic non-problematic play videos coming up on the front page, but we also want to start [a more in-depth video analysis program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pdcpyf/trainers_behaviorists_replacement_for_donna_hills/) on a recurring basis. This will be a good opportunity to practice your dog behaviour observation skills - we will be encouraging people to really tease apart individual components and include timestamps, rather than just a simple overall assessment. So [here’s a poll](https://forms.gle/7vshDAAJGoaQnwir5) for you so that we can find your preferences on the format and frequency of these reviews!  

  
Thanks and happy dog training,

37,Dogtraining,When did you realize you had successfully trained your dog well?,"Been training my almost 3 year old Alaskan Malamute to withhold from food unless given a release signal ever since she was a puppy (she was a very naughty dog when it came to stealing food) Well… I was preparing her raw meal right before I went to shower and cook some food, and it had many treats in it that she LOVED, she was whining as I was preparing her meal and couldn’t sit still! I set her food right beside her while giving her the command to lie down and wait as usual. I completely forgot to release her to eat! Normally I give her the okay within a minute, or walk away and come back and release her. But I forgot- I went about my evening, came back 30 minutes later to go hang up my towel and I found her drooling next to her bowl in the exact same position I left her. I was so SHOCKED. I always knew I had a good dog, but holy… she really is a REALLY good dog!!! I felt so proud but so bad at the time. I gave her extra treats in her meal lol! When was the moment you realized you trained your pup well?","When did you realize you had successfully trained your dog well?

39,Dogtraining,"Dog is suddenly skittish towards me, seemingly no reason","&amp;#x200B;

Female German Shepherd, 2 years old. I do everything with her, take her on walks, socialize her by taking her to Lowe's, etc. She goes kayaking with me at the lake and is like an emotional support dog for me.

Suddenly she is acting very skittish towards me, as if she has done something wrong. Has to be told several times to ""come"". And sometimes she will hurry away with her head down, run upstairs. A few times she has actually been shaking.

There are some parts of the house (like our family room) where she'll obey ""come""... but if it's in another part of the house, she'll run away.

As far as I know, nothing changed to trigger this. Have never been mean to the dog or scolded her. At a loss for why this is happening.

In an earlier post, it was suggested to rule out anything medically wrong. I have taken her to the vet and she's good in that aspect.","Dog is suddenly skittish towards me, seemingly no reason &amp;#x200B;

44,Dogtraining,"How important is the ""don't greet your dog excitedly when you come home"" rule?","We sought out a lot of advice from trainers and experienced dog owners we first adopted our girl in 2020. One of the rules that came up often (if not always) was, ""Make sure you don't make a big deal when you come home."". Well, we're terrible at following that rule. Whether we're gone for 2 hours or 2 minutes, we basically throw a parade in her honor when we walk through the door. She loves it. And we love seeing her zoomies and booty wiggles, lol. For what it's worth, she has no separation anxiety when we're gone (we check on her through the doggy cam), she has no problem being dropped off places (like the vet or occasional daycare), and she doesn't jump or get too excited when other people come over. I only started wondering about this because a dog experienced friend of mine said, ""You shouldn't do that. You should basically ignore her for a few minutes when you come home"". Is this just a training preference, or are we doing something that may cause problems in the long run?

I know dogs keep their urine to mark territory could it just be her marking ??
She just does it without a care in the world.

46,Dogtraining,Doggo needs constant attention when boyfriend is over,"Hello everyone I have a little doggy pictured in the comments below, who I have lived alone with almost his entire 6 year life. We spend a ton of time together cuddling and hanging out. I am almost always available to him since I started working from home 2 years ago. I have started dating someone so he’s over frequently and Chief needs both of our attention on him at all times when he’s over. Even if we’re standing and kiss he loses his mind, he’s got a great beagle scream-bark he uses nonstop! If we sit on the couch and our attention isn’t on him he will cry until my boyfriend pays attention to him. 

This is only exacerbated if we go into a room and close the door. He will sit outside and cry and paw at the door until we let him in. I tried freezing some peanut butter, baby food and cheese in a Kong and giving that to him when we closed the door. That worked for a while, but he eventually realized we were in another room and came to the door, repeat performance. 

I really would like for him to be more independent and confident when I’m not right there with him, or he’s not part of an interaction I’m having with my boyfriend. Any advice?","Doggo needs constant attention when boyfriend is over Hello everyone I have a little doggy pictured in the comments below, who I have lived alone with almost his entire 6 year life.

$20/week budget. In Sydney, Australia if that helps. No food allergies or intolerances. Like meat but always thought I could swing being a vegetarian. 

I am a tiny person (100 lbs) and my maintenance calories are 1200. 

I really enjoy drinks (tea, soda, alcohol, juices, smoothies) and dessert (chocolate, baked goods). I used to spend a lot on these things, either store bought or homemade but with my new lifestyle I can’t afford to do that anymore. 

I have the following appliances: pressure cooker (equivalent to Instant Pot), air fryer, Sodastream, sandwich press, coffee machine, kettle, NutriBullet. Also have an oven and a stove. 

Currently in the pantry: essential spices (S&amp;P, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cinnamon powder, garlic granules, lemon herb pepper, cajun pepper), 2kg whey isolate protein powder, steel cut oats, honey, rice. 

My biggest issue is that I’ve never done the whole “eat cheap” thing before, as I had a decent food budget until I increased my cost of living in anticipation of full time employment that ended up being delayed by a year. (Please, no lectures on counting your chickens before they hatch - I already torment myself plenty)

I’ve been surviving on pressure cooker-made chicken soup, and it’s delicious, but I spent $80 the other day buying ingredients for two soup recipes and it made me rethink the whole “soup is cheap” battle cry. I’m pretty sure I’m doing something horrifically wrong and don’t know how to fix this.

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses. I feel very overwhelmed at present, but will reply as soon as I am able to. I also wanted to clarify a couple of frequently raised points: 
1. Food banks in my area all appear to be closed for another week. I will be making contact once they reopen.
2. I have already trimmed the fat from my lifestyle, so to speak. I am in a very complicated situation with my finances, and no stone has been left unturned. 
3. I am working part time, and currently on the lookout for a second part time job, as my first job does not give me enough hours.

60,family,I kinda feel dumped by mom ... am I being oversensitive ?,"Well i'm a 22 male . I live with my mom and 2 brothers . we really are very close to eachother after my dad left us for like 10 years now . 

So , along the years I don't know if it's true or not but i feel like my mom prefers my older brother than me . btw i'm the middle bro.  When she has an argument with him and he may get angry and do some bad stuff , like a couple of hours pass or even a day and they get good together again . As for me , If i litterally just get her  a bit angry she shall not talk to me like for a weak or smt and act as it doesn't even matter for her. 

too much stuff like this to say so i hope u understand what i want to say 

my main problem here is : 

my last birthday was in september when we all have summer vacation so we kinda have time to celebrate . but , what happened is , not a single one of them did even remember my birthday and the day passed like any other day . I remember only mom writing a 2 - lines post on fb . 

so I was a bit mad and spoke to mom and told her how disappointed I am . For my surprise, she got mad at me and how i'm so shallow and that they all have stuff to do and that my big brother is surely busy with his work  and we are kinda grown ups and we DO NOT NEED to care about these stuff . So on that love is in the heart and it doesn't have to be expressed . 

well I got past it and didn't make it a big deal . 

today, it's my big brother birthday . I have exams from yesterday for like 1 month long in Medical faculty , so I really am short in time and over stressed by studying . But for my surprise , mom woke up so early today and started setting up the house with decorations and gifts . Then she started making a cake and ordered his favorite food . 

So , I told her that I'm short in time and maybe we can delay it for tomorrow after my exam so I could have some time till the next exam . but she answered that I still have a month to go and today is his birthday so it can't be tomorrow . 

I'm a bit frustrated .....actually I'm so disappointed and feel so dumped . But maybe the circumstances differ . Am I shallow ? or that really hurts to see you being neglected ?","I kinda feel dumped by mom ... am I being oversensitive ? Well i'm a 22 male .

62,family,Feeling unmotivated after death of mother....,"Hi, just in need of a little advice or some suggestions here...

We lost Mom on 12/10/21.

I can't seem to get out of bed. I don't want to get out of bed. I feel like I don't even have the energy to get out of bed. 
If I could, I would lay here all day... and the next... and the next. 

I don't think I grieved right because I don't cry about her often, and when I do it's really short and only a few tears... But we were so close. I don't understand this. 
 I try not to think about her, and when I do it seems like my world is crashing again. Over and over. Each time I think about it.

I feel like I can't go on anymore a lot of the time. 

I feel hopeless with my life. 

I can't remember anything from my childhood. I already have memory problems, but I feel like they've gotten a lot worse since this has happened. 
So bad, that I forgot what time my workplace closed last night, and ended up closing early, forgot to do a lot of things that I normally would not forget. 
 
I often feel very lazy and belittle myself for sitting in this bed so much. 

I can see it in my father too. He tells me that it's hard to start the day. 


If anyone has been through anything similar, how did you overcome this feeling of laziness after a close death? I feel like I haven't even started the stages of grief yet. I saw that there were 5 stages. 

Is it normal not to cry much after a very close death? 

Is it normal to experience extreme memory loss after a very close death? 


 I'm not sure if this is not the right group to post in, I've only posted in one other place before, so forgive me if I'm in the wrong place.","Feeling unmotivated after death of mother.... Hi, just in need of a little advice or some suggestions here...

66,family,My sister blocked me,"
Me and my sister had a few arguments over Christmas which ended in her blocking me on everything and not talking to me if we crossed paths.
In the past I did so many favours for her and when I asked for her to help me (returning the favour) she rejected it. She blocked me then unblocked me after a day or so.
Next, we had an argument. She blocked me and hasn’t unblocked me or spoke to me since. I thought she’d atleast be a bit human and unblock me on New Years but that wasn’t the case. She still isn’t talking to me and I don’t want to beg to chat to her when I have my own family and am pregnant again. 
She wants to be stubborn. Is there any ways to get over her? I haven’t blocked her on my end but now I’m thinking I should?","My sister blocked me

67,family,My dad has changed and it's hard to stay close. Advice?,"I'm a college student who is home for winter break. I stay with my dad, and we usually have a good relationship..but the pandemic has changed him. It's caused us to argue, disagree about so many things, and overall drive me away from him.
I'm probably at fault too, but my dad has changed a lot and literally everyone has noticed/asks me if he's okay. For example:

He's very much against the vaccine, to the point where he makes himself the victim (for example, he seems to think the side effects of the vaccine are worse than people dying from the virus). I can respect people's decisions even if I disagree with them, but he will talk about it for HOURS, every day, and I believe that he has some wrong/over-exaggerated information.

He's also into health a lot, but specifically how much he hates doctors and how natural remedies (oils, supplements, etc) are the way to go. I do think that they are important, but again, he talks about it ALL THE TIME. He also complains about how my sisters and I don't follow his health advice so we must be lazy and not care about our health. But at this point I'm way too busy to follow all his advice and I don't even want to when it's all I hear about all day every day. I feel bad saying that.

He almost favors me and my youngest sister (P) over our other sister (B). He takes our mental health seriously but has apparently disregarded B's cries for help. It sickens me how he talks about her sometimes. Yes she isn't the perfect person, but none of us are! She doesn't deserve the backlash my dad gives her. Some of it maybe, but definitely not most of it.

And finally, he dumps his emotional baggage on me. I phrase it that way because that's how it feels. He talks about everything that upsets him, and one big one is my sisters. They're older now (15 &amp; 18) and spend most of their time with their friends. They usually come over on the weekends since they live with our mom during the week. But he will constantly complain about how they don't share anything with him. But here's why...whenever we confide in him, he reacts the same way: he says ""stop crying"" and then goes on to lecture us on how to feel better. We do not want that, we want comfort. But he doesn't understand how to do that, and we've told him multiple times but nothing has changed. So my sisters have stopped telling him personal things, which makes sense. But he will constantly mope about it to me and makes it about him. Like, ""why do they treat me this way? Why do they tell your mom more than they tell me? I'm not the bad guy"" stuff like that. It irks me but especially stresses me out because I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT STUFF. It almost feels like I'm his therapist sometimes.
I completely shut off when this happens, and I hate it. Part of me thinks, he just needs someone to talk to. But another part of me thinks: I'm literally his daughter, he should not be talking about this with me!!!!

So yeah...I would love some advice. I have intense guilt issues so this is weighing on me a lot. Am I overreacting and being too sensitive? Am I reasonable in not wanting to spend time with him anymore? I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: My dad only talks about certain topics that stress me out and vents to me about his mental health. I can't handle it anymore but am I just overreacting?","My dad has changed and it's hard to stay close. Advice? I'm a college student who is home for winter break.

68,family,How to help my brother open up,"Recently, our father passed away.  My family never had a close relationship with our father (to put it mildly).  My brother, for the first time in his life, expressed to me how unhappy he was with himself.

He, like our father, never showed vulnerability, and the only emotions he usually showed (other than joy/happiness) were frustration, anger, or other negative feelings.  He told me that he was worried he has become like our father and hates himself for it.  He is also worried he'll eventually be alienated from his kids due to his behavior.

I was never comfortable to bring this up with my brother in the past since he is short-tempered and always cut short any conversations related to self-improvement (he is sensitive and viewed anything directed towards him as a personal attack).  However, with our father's passing, my brother opened up to me, and I want to make sure I can help him since he is aware of his behavior and seems to want to change.

I'm looking for ideas on how to help him.  He is currently adamantly against seeing a therapist.  I am trying some things and have talked with my SIL, but I do not want to expose too much detail in this post in case he sees this.  I am trying to help him see that he *can* change, that it's worth the effort (in order to have better view of himself and to develop a stronger relationship with his kids), and ways in which he can be happier (he is full of stress).  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

69,family,How much can you really communicate with Mum/Aunt (her sister),"So I kinda need advice on this, some context: 

My mum is a big hoarder and she likes to buy new things but never throw out anything old. My house has become so cluttered to a point where I feel frustrated, upset and embarrassed about my home living situation.

I never dared to invite friends home because of how messy, dirty and dusty it is. 

I've tried to tell and talk to my mum about keeping things neat and throwing away things she doesn't need. But she's the kind who thinks that everything is important and everything needs to be kept. I tried cleaning some areas of the house but she somehow manages to clutter it pretty soon after the clean up.

And every single time I bring up this cleaning conversation, she shuts me down with a ""You don't need to care about what I'm doing! Just leave me alone."" My dad and brother, who's tried to help a few years ago, is also over helping her, as when they tried to clean up the apartment, it somehow ended in a cold war as she does not like people touching her things.

I've described and talked to her so many times how it's affecting me, and how the living situation is making me frustrated and unhappy which she always seems to listen but never takes any action. 

Spoke to her sister (she's 64) recently about this, and her sister thinks there's still that filial piety we have to fulfill considering she's my mum and all we need to do is talk to her nicely. She seems to have this ideal that as long as we take the time to talk things with my mum, she will listen.

But the thing is we (mainly me) have spoken to her more than 10 times about cleaning up and yet she shuts me down every single time. 

I've resorted to moving to my aunt's house (dad's sister) so i avoid less head butting with my mum but her sister thinks that I can't avoid this problem forever and should hash it out.


The question is: 
1) How much can I really communicate with my mum such that she considers my point of view

2) How do I tell her sister that it's honestly futile effort and it's just so difficult to change someone, especially when it's my mother (she's 62)? 

3) Do I really not avoid this problem and just keep butting heads with my mum which may even strain our relationship?

:(

We have this (mostly) weekly discussion thread for a few reasons. We know some people are hesitant to create a new post for a small question they may have, so this is a good place to start. Or many wise redditors have tips and tricks to share. Well, this is the place to to to that.  

This is especially important as a growing community we find ourselves having to limit the posts that may be off-topic to the primary purpose of the sub (home improvement questions and project-sharing posts). These topics include home warranty companies, household tips, general painting advice, room layouts, or rants about companies, contractors, and previous owners. While these may be of interest, we are trying hard to provide a venue that will both allow, and constrain, the conversation. Thus, this thread. Thank you for participating.

Recently, the prices of lumber and other home improvement goods has been slowly normalizing, but we will still leave this portion in for the time being as they are still inflated and some people are shocked by the price of some quotes and the like.

72,HomeImprovement,I bought a Ryobi Drill and Driver set and can NOT recommend it,"A few weeks ago, I asked for recommendations here for a drill and driver set. I ended up going with this Ryobi One + HP set :  https://www.homedepot.com/p/RYOBI-ONE-HP-18V-Brushless-Cordless-Compact-1-2-in-Drill-and-Impact-Driver-Kit-with-2-1-5-Ah-Batteries-Charger-and-Bag-PSBCK01K/313438682

I used it a few weeks on a few small honey-do projects and also removing deck stairs (lots of fasteners). I’m not a fan and will be returning it and will look at Dewalt or Bosch as a replacement for my current 10+ year old Bosch set. 

Pros: The main reason I chose Ryobi was because they are inexpensive and use the same battery for a lot of their other line of tools. I’m just a homeowner diy’er and didn’t feel the need to spend the money on what a pro / contractor would use (e.g., Milwaukee)

Cons (quirks?):
They just feel cheap (compared to my Bosch set and my neighbors Dewalt set. Cheap plastic, not solid feeling, etc. 

They sound like a toy with a high pitched whine (again, compared to the Bosch and Dewalt set). 

Now for my real issues with them: the chuck on the impact is already acting up. The spring loaded mechanism doesn’t always work so I have to pull on the chuck to insert a bit nearly 90% of the time. It’s only 3 weeks old…. 

The trigger doesn’t activate on the first pull 20% of the time, but will on the subsequent second pull of the trigger. 

The impact action seems louder and more ear piercing, maybe it’s just higher pitched, but I used ear plugs for comfort when I never felt the need to with my Bosch. 

It’s too bad because Ryobi seems to have a great line of inexpensive tools that I was planning to buy that are compatible with these batteries. Dewalt also has compatible battery tools but tend to be at least 30% more expensive than the Ryobi equivalents. 

Anyone else share these feelings about Ryobi? Maybe I got the batch that was built on a Friday afternoon…","I bought a Ryobi Drill and Driver set and can NOT recommend it A few weeks ago, I asked for recommendations here for a drill and driver set.

73,HomeImprovement,I feel like I'm being discriminated against for being poor.,"I apologize if this isn't the right sub, but hear me out.

I have been trying to obtain quotes for various projects to account for budgeting next year. I've done a ton of work to this house myself, but some things are out of my wheelhouse or involve work I'm not good at, like drywall mud and overhead work.

Once I give a place my address, they suddenly seem less interested in coming out. I live in an older, lower income part of town. 

I needed a quote to drywall my kitchen and hallway ceiling, and had a drywall company come out. I noticed they didn't even take measurements and said they would email me a quote within a week. Two weeks pass, and I call and leave a message. A week later without reply, I text them and I saw it had been read, but no reply.

It's been extremely depressing because if I drive by the more affluent parts of town, I see all kinds of work being done. But anymore it seems like money pretty much dictates everything in life. 

I need to put new wall cabinets up next year sometime, but can't do so until the ceiling is fixed. A lot of projects I can do myself are ""layered"". I can do A and B, but until I have C done by another company, I can't do anything but sit and stare and grow frustrated. 

Ghosting seems so damn common anymore. If your backed up or simply not interested in the job, then tell me.","I feel like I'm being discriminated against for being poor. I apologize if this isn't the right sub, but hear me out.

74,HomeImprovement,Muriatic acid damage in basement renovation,"Hi all,

I have been renovating the basement in a house I recently purchased. The basement did have existing walls, but needed significant upgrades which I have been doing myself over the past few months. I have been nearing completion, getting down to paint and finishes, and a little patching in the slab.

I hired a crew to do some drywall work, and remove the peeling paint that had previously been applied to the slab floor and apply an epoxy paint and topcoat. Originally we had discussed grinding the painted floor, but halfway through the job (post drywall, pre painting), the owner’s son took over the project. He said they wanted to try using an acid to loosen the paint and then scrape it off. He said they would test it first and work in sections.

I went away for six days to visit family over Christmas, and gave them access to the lower level to work while I was away. When I returned, I found they had applied muriatic acid to the entirety of the floors (800+ sq ft), and not returned. All windows and exterior doors were closed, and they had a fan running. I’m not sure how long it had been sitting. They did not return the first day I was back, and only came out the second day after repeated phone calls.

The damage is pretty extensive, and I’m not sure the remedy or how to proceed here. The running fan and enclosed space led to me having a coating of muriatic acid on everything. It’s on the walls and ceiling, corroding my exposed plumbing in the bathroom I had spent significant time renovating, I didn’t have faceplates on a number of switches, outlets, and junction boxes and all exposed wiring and terminals are corroded, my water main as well. I had recently installed mini splits and one is fried and I assume the other is damaged.

Yesterday when they came back I had them apply a baking soda solution to the floor to neutralize the acid. The son was apologetic and admitted fault and said he wasn’t aware that the acid had been applied and left. He agreed to replace the mini splits if my HVAC guy deemed necessary. At that time I hadn’t noticed the other damage to the electric and plumbing.

Two rooms I had planned to paint, but now the third is required as well. The textured popcorn ceiling I’m assuming is saturated, which I had planned to leave but now would rather have scraped and painted. 

So I’m here wondering if anyone can say the extent of the damage to the wiring and plumbing and what the best course of action here is? He’s made it clear he accepts responsibility and wants to fix it, but also that was before I thought an electrician and plumber should be involved. Try to work it out with them, or hire out the repairs including finishing the painting? Get a GC in here to deal with it all? Unfortunately I’m leaving again in two days for a week and won’t be able to get anyone in in that time. The painting company has been in business a long time in the area and is highly reviewed and insured.

I planned to post pictures of the damage but realized you can’t in this community. The exposed wires all have green oxidation as well as my exposed plumbing. 

Thanks.","Muriatic acid damage in basement renovation Hi all,

75,HomeImprovement,[UPDATE] Parent’s House. Fixes cost $100k. We will renovate.,"Happy New Year everyone! This is an update from my previous post on Christmas about my parents 3,550 sq ft house sitting on 2 acres. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/ro6bjz/parents_house_fixes_cost_100k_value_300k400k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Pics of the house, except it doesn’t include the moldy parts: https://imgur.com/a/Y3ZL12Q

It has been an incredibly stressful week for our family but has come to the decision to renovate. Here’s the series of events that happened during the last week:

- Christmas Eve: Toilets clogged
- Christmas Day: Sewage coming up from toilet and showers. Water coming out from underneath my sister’s floor (wtf?!?)
- Day 3: Septic tank company comes to clear septic tank, initial camera work identifies a break in the pipes. Plumber fixes the toilets. But the pipes will still leak until fixed ($1800 for service). Cameras were unable to go through all the pipes to do full diagnostics. 

It will cost another $3,100 to install clean outs to run cameras through and do hydro jet bc kitchen pipes are clogged. 

And once the clean outs are installed then further camera work can be done. I’m expecting full pipe repair to be somewhere from $20k-$40k. They were not installed properly 25 years ago. 

Our whole family is pissed off at each other. And now everyone is saying sell, sell, sell EXCEPT my dad. He says he wants to retire in the house. My family starts gathering data on Sell+buy vs reno+keep. 

DAY 4: OpenDoor completes their interior and exterior assessment. Their preliminary offer was “$450k”.  But now the Opendoor broker team declines to extend an offer because “we could not find enough comparables”. Apparently, Opendoor will only buy properties that have enough similar comps. Otherwise it’s too much risk. The rep said the condition of the house was not an issue   It was just not enough data on similar houses. 

Also, my mom runs a credit check. It turns out her middle lower credit is 735. She can qualify for a HELOC loan at 2.75%. She still has to apply and we will make sure it’s a locked IR. This is when we start seriously considering reno. 

I meet with a carpenter who has known my dad for 7 years. Started a reno business. We walk through the house. Initial estimates are $60k.

Today: We check out a cookie cutter house at 3,400 sq ft on the same side of town. But it sits on .5 acres. It has no backyard. Well, the backyard is 3 other neighbors. It costs $490,000. I’m shocked. 

I find a 3,200 sq ft, 1.5 acre house for sale in a gated community 5 min drive from my parents. I visit it. It’s clearly fancier, has a pool, and newer. It’s selling for $735k. This house’s agent is pretty cool and I tell him about our situation. He says don’t sell. Do whatever we can to keep the land we have. Super valuable with all of the growth. Rent or sell later. 

There are only 6 2-acre homes selling in ALL of SA, all at least $1M price tags.

We’ve decided to renovate and keep. I would like to say thank you for the 350+ comments on the previous thread. Mostly people saying sell as-is. My family has learned an incredible amount from Reddit and undoubtedly you all saved us money already. My parents admitted they haven’t been able to take care of the house properly. But my mom thinks with more time and her retirement pension money coming in regularly then can focus on fixing, cleaning, decluttering the house. We watched Marie Kondo last night. 

We undoubtedly are taking the harder road. My siblings and I will have to take turns flying in this year. My mom will take out a $50k HELOC. I’ll convert $50k stock. We likely will have to hire house help later. Hoping this will pay off in the end. 

Sounds like I’ll be more active around here. I also learned a ton about real estate. I need to diversify so I’m going to learn about RE investing. Great thank you to everyone here. Talk more soon.","[UPDATE] Parent’s House. Fixes cost $100k. We will renovate. Happy New Year everyone! This is an update from my previous post on Christmas about my parents 3,550 sq ft house sitting on 2 acres. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/ro6bjz/parents_house_fixes_cost_100k_value_300k400k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Pics of the house, except it doesn’t include the moldy parts: https://imgur.com/a/Y3ZL12Q

It has been an incredibly stressful week for our family but has come to the decision to renovate. Here’s the series of events that happened during the last week:

- Christmas Eve: Toilets clogged
- Christmas Day: Sewage coming up from toilet and showers. Water coming out from underneath my sister’s floor (wtf?!?)
- Day 3: Septic tank company comes to clear septic tank, initial camera work identifies a break in the pipes. Plumber fixes the toilets. But the pipes will still leak until fixed ($1800 for service). Cameras were unable to go through all the pipes to do full diagnostics. 

It will cost another $3,100 to install clean outs to run cameras through and do hydro jet bc kitchen pipes are clogged. 

And once the clean outs are installed then further camera work can be done. I’m expecting full pipe repair to be somewhere from $20k-$40k. They were not installed properly 25 years ago. 

Our whole family is pissed off at each other. And now everyone is saying sell, sell, sell EXCEPT my dad. He says he wants to retire in the house. My family starts gathering data on Sell+buy vs reno+keep. 

DAY 4: OpenDoor completes their interior and exterior assessment. Their preliminary offer was “$450k”.  But now the Opendoor broker team declines to extend an offer because “we could not find enough comparables”. Apparently, Opendoor will only buy properties that have enough similar comps. Otherwise it’s too much risk. The rep said the condition of the house was not an issue   It was just not enough data on similar houses. 

Also, my mom runs a credit check. It turns out her middle lower credit is 735. She can qualify for a HELOC loan at 2.75%. She still has to apply and we will make sure it’s a locked IR. This is when we start seriously considering reno. 

I meet with a carpenter who has known my dad for 7 years. Started a reno business. We walk through the house. Initial estimates are $60k. Renovate kitchen, all bathrooms, put in LVP flooring, paint, repair damages (except pipes). He gave me four previous client references I can call. Pics of his previous work looks solid.

77,HomeImprovement,Help resolving dim LED glow when off (probably due to bad grounding),"Recently installed a new ceiling fan with LED light. When the light is turned off, there remains some amount of current sufficient to create a dim glow unless I kill power to the whole device (wall switch). The fan is only run while sleeping, so the dim light isn’t great. 

From what I’m reading, this can be caused by bad grounding. This is an old home with no grounding line, so the ground is just attached to the ceiling box. Assuming this is the actual issue, how might one improve the grounding without making this into a larger project? Might a zener diode be a solution? 

Is there something I may be missing here?

Edit: While not an ideal solution, I added rubber standoffs between the light fixture back and it’s attach point and then installed the cover to hold it all together. With no metal on metal contact, the glow is gone. I’d love to circle back with a better solution. This fix is fine for now (aesthetically and operationally everything is as expected).","Help resolving dim LED glow when off (probably due to bad grounding) Recently installed a new ceiling fan with LED light.

114,MachineLearning,[D] What are the recent breakthroughs for the generative models for art?,"Hey everyone,

I am interested in the recent developments or models in the area of Neural Style Transfer (I am also interested in other applications in art, not only Neural Style Transfer, so feel free to point those as well). What are the mostly used models in this area nowadays? Can you point me to the papers?

Thanks a lot!","[D] What are the recent breakthroughs for the generative models for art? Hey everyone,

115,MachineLearning,[D] Machine learning alternative to MCMC or Nested Sampling?,"For work I'm regularly in the position of having to fit complex models to datasets. For the most part it involves defining some kind of likelihood function (merit function) that uses a certain set of parameters to find the distance between a model and data. Currently, the standard methods for this in my field are usually MCMC (and their variants) and Nested Sampling. 

MCMCs and NS are a robust and safe way to find the global minimum/maximun, but in high-dimensional parameter spaces they become very slow. I'm right now running a (possibly) month long NS chain, just for an exploratory test (in a 32 cores PC). While a month-long run could be OK-ish for a definitive result, it is not feasible for exploratory exercises (I really can't do one each time I tweak a thing). 

Is there any fast/efficient alternative to MCMC or Nested sampling out there? Something that, while might not be as safe as Nested Sampling, could give me a good estimate of the best set of parameters in a significantly shorter run?","[D] Machine learning alternative to MCMC or Nested Sampling?
