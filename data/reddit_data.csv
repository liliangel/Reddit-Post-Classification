Hello, all. During the month of December, the sub book club will be reading **Firekeeper's Daughter** by Angeline Boulley. Each week there will be a discussion thread and when we are done, Angeline herself will be joining us for an AMA.

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52346471-firekeeper-s-daughter) (feel free to skip if you prefer to know nothing going into the book as the description contains minor spoilers):

&gt; As a biracial, unenrolled tribal member and the product of a scandal, eighteen-year-old Daunis Fontaine has never quite fit in, both in her hometown and on the nearby Ojibwe reservation. Daunis dreams of studying medicine, but when her family is struck by tragedy, she puts her future on hold to care for her fragile mother.  
&gt;  
&gt;The only bright spot is meeting Jamie, the charming new recruit on her brother Levi’s hockey team. Yet even as Daunis falls for Jamie, certain details don’t add up and she senses the dashing hockey star is hiding something. Everything comes to light when Daunis witnesses a shocking murder, thrusting her into the heart of a criminal investigation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reluctantly, Daunis agrees to go undercover, but secretly pursues her own investigation, tracking down the criminals with her knowledge of chemistry and traditional medicine. But the deceptions—and deaths—keep piling up and soon the threat strikes too close to home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, Daunis must learn what it means to be a strong Anishinaabe kwe (Ojibwe woman) and how far she'll go to protect her community, even if it tears apart the only world she’s ever known. 

Please note that this month's selection is a **young adult** novel. If you would like to view potential content warnings for the book, a reader suggested list may be found [here](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/407cfca7-5e41-4777-bfcd-1edc4e70ea96/content_warnings).

4,books,I just finished reading The subtle art of not giving a fuck.,"I'm a fifteen-year-old boy from Denmark, currently in 9th grade. I just read The subtle art of not giving a fuck, and I liked it. I feel like the main takeaway is that, not caring is synonymous with caring about something of greater importance. In my example, caring about becoming a better writer, will make typing on the internet to 20 million people - in my second language - less overwhelming, because it will push the barriers of comfort slightly. And even if no one reads or replies it's fine, because that's not the metric I use to determine success, since the goal was just to write in a subreddit with 20 million members.

5,books,I don’t think I would have enjoyed nor understood Lord of the Rings as much as I have if it didn’t include a map of Middle-Earth,"I just finished the second book (The Two Towers) which I have read blind; not having read them before or seeing the movies. 


And I’ve got to say, it has been such an enjoyable experience so far and I don’t think any book I’ve read prior could compete. 


A lot of this has to do with the map. Tolkien’s use of geographical language would have gone right over my head if I didn’t have a map to refer to. Not to mention when a place or area is mentioned by a character I will always giddily look to the map to see where it is they’re talking about. I love tracing back the journey the characters have taken and reminiscing about everything that has gone down at certain points in their travels. It’s a great tool to help visualise the world and what’s going on. 


What does everyone else think about this and does a map in a book elevate your enjoyment?","I don’t think I would have enjoyed nor understood Lord of the Rings as much as I have if it didn’t include a map of Middle-Earth I just finished the second book (The Two Towers) which I have read blind; not having read them before or seeing the movies.

7,books,Just read iRobot by Isaac Asimov,"Why did they even give that movie with Will Smith the same name? The only similarities between the two is robots, and the 3 Robotic laws. I hate when movies do that. It’s just like World War Z, where the only similarity between the the book and the movie is that there’s zombies. 

What’s incredibly frustrating about both is the storyline in the books is so much better than the movies. Harder to translate to screen for sure, they’d both work better as a series, but still. I’m also realizing as I write this the similarities between World War Z and iRobot with their screen adaptations. Both books are interviews about different stories, and both movies just made up some completely different storyline and used the same name.

Anyway, I loved the book. I would’ve read it much earlier if I had known the movie was nothing like it. If you enjoy books that delve into what separates man from machine, I’d definitely suggest iRobot by Isaac Asimov.","Just read iRobot by Isaac Asimov Why did they even give that movie with Will Smith the same name?

Mine is Richard Brautigan. He’s one of my dad’s favourite authors as well, and I will never ever forget the time I finished Sombrero Fallout in a day (it has been my favourite book since the moment I read it). No other author has ever compared to the emotion his literature evokes in me and I want it to stay that way, I feel loyal to his work almost. I have a great relationship with my dad, but Brautigan links us in such a special way that nothing other than literature could. 

I feel sorry for people who deny themselves the pleasure of reading, it’s so much more than words on a page. My dad sharing Brautigan with me is one of the most treasured things in my heart. 

I love Brautigan both poetry and prose for his surrealism, his use of metaphor, the beautiful turn of phrase he used which I can best describe as refreshing, humorous, and sometimes melancholy. 

This has turned into a bit of an emotional rant, but I love my dad and I love Brautigan. I wish I could tell him what I thought of his literature, the tears and laughs he has brought me and my pops. Rest in peace Richard.","The author that occupies a space in your heart Who is yours?

11,books,"Public Domain Day! January 1st, 2022","New works entering the public domain.


A. A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh

Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises

Dorothy Parker, Enough Rope (her first collection of poems)

Langston Hughes, The Weary Blues

T. E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (later adapted into the film Lawrence of Arabia)

&gt;Why celebrate the public domain? When works go into the public domain, they can legally be shared, without permission or fee. That is something Winnie-the-Pooh would appreciate. Community theaters can screen the films. Youth orchestras can perform the music publicly, without paying licensing fees. Online repositories such as the Internet Archive, HathiTrust, and Google Books can make works fully available online. This helps enable access to cultural materials that might otherwise be lost to history. 1926 was a long time ago. The vast majority of works from 1926 are out of circulation. When they enter the public domain in 2022, anyone can rescue them from obscurity and make them available, where we can all discover, enjoy, and breathe new life into them.

&gt;The public domain is also a wellspring for creativity. The whole point of copyright is to promote creativity, and the public domain plays a central role in doing so. Copyright law gives authors important rights that encourage creativity and distribution—this is a very good thing. But it also ensures that those rights last for a “limited time,” so that when they expire, works go into the public domain, where future authors can legally build on the past—reimagining the books, making them into films, adapting the songs and movies. That’s a good thing too! 

&gt;As explained in a New York Times editorial:
When a work enters the public domain it means the public can afford to use it freely, to give it new currency . . . [public domain works] are an essential part of every artist’s sustenance, of every person’s sustenance. 3 
Just as Shakespeare’s works have given us everything from 10 Things I Hate About You and Kiss Me Kate (from The Taming of the Shrew) to West Side Story (from Romeo and Juliet), who knows what the works entering the public domain in 2022 might inspire? As with Shakespeare, the ability to freely reimagine these works may spur a range of creativity, from the serious to the whimsical, and in doing so allow the original artists’ legacies to endure.*

14,books,Doomsday Book by Connie Willis - The perfect book for the moment.,"I finished Doomsday Book today and besides being one of the best books I've read this year, it's also the perfect time to read it.

It's a sci-fi/historical fiction time travel story following a dual narrative, one in 2050s Oxford where a flu epidemic has broken out and the other a village just outside Oxford 1348, the year of the Black Death. Both timelines are set in December.

The future timeline mostly plays out like a medical drama as the characters wrestle with the pandemic and also concerns over whether something had gone wrong with the 'drop'. The book is fairly long and I've seen some complaints about how often characters are one the phone trying to get through to someone else: the phones are jammed/all the techs are on 'vac'/head of department's unreachable etc. But personally I felt Willis did such a good job of realising her characters and putting me in their shoes that I found it tense and engaging throughout.

Undoubtedly though, the 1300s part of the book is the most impactful. The portrait of medieval village and it's 40 something inhabitants beautifully done. Particularly the priest and the family who take in Kivrin, our historian from the future. They're some of the most vivid characters I've read this year.

So yeah, I don't want to say anymore other than I obviously highly recommend 'Doomsday book'. It's the first of four in Willis's 'Oxford Time Travel' series, the others go to different historical periods.

I can completely understand how this ranks as many peoples top book, or at least among them. I think the empathetic perspective of an affair through a woman’s eyes is refreshing even in modern day. Most dramas like this you see on Netflix or TV usually involves multiple perspectives that never center the most vulnerable party (in this case, the woman’s) feelings and thought processes.

19,books,Just finished reading One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Márquez... What should I take away from it?,"One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Márquez has been on my ""To Read"" list for a long time and I finally got around to reading it, but it was a TOUGH read. Took a couple months to champ through, and my first comment after reading the last page was ""What. The. Actual. ****?""

There was so much I LOVED about the book from the flowery writing, to the nonchalance of the magical realism, but I wish I was more mentally prepared for some of the... recurring themes and actions throughout the book and (Kinda Spoiler Warnings) the book/story of the town of Macando seemed to wrap itself up by disappearing off the face of the Earth with the torrential winds. 

I enjoyed the history repeating itself with Aurelianos and Arcadios (mostly) following the same paths, but plenty of the family deaths seemed almost pointless, where plenty of their ends had me thinking, ""Oh yeah, I forgot that character was still alive."" 

I'm still trying to compartmentalize all my jumbled thoughts about the book, but for all the beauty, grandeur, and tribulations that surrounded Macondo, the town kinda just fell off into obscurity. I guess I can be cliche and say, ""It's not about the destination, but the journey and memories made along the way?""

Would greatly appreciate to hear takeaways and afterthoughts from anyone else who've read the book!","Just finished reading One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Márquez...

21,books,The Dogs of Christmas by Bruce Cameron,"I absolutely adore the *A Dog's Purpose* trilogy, so when I came across Cameron's other canine one-off novel, *The Dogs of Christmas*, I snatched it up quick. Unfortunately, after reading it I'm left with something of a bad taste.

The writing style doesn't read at all like Cameron's other novels. Even taking into consideration a shift of perspective (the story is told through the eyes of the human character rather than the dog) it just doesn't feel right. It's very rushed and lacks any real thought. Not to mention, pretty much every character strikes me as a raging dumpster fire. They are completely unlikeable and made the book so, so tedious to get through. This is especially true of the main character, Josh, who is not only a creep --

*Josh realized he was watching her bend over with considerable approval.* &lt;-- Literally the first time he meets main female character, Kerri.

-- but also exhibits obsessive and stalkerish tendencies for the rest of the book. It actually made me uncomfortable at parts. And we're supposed to root for this guy? Uhm..

Is it just me? Maybe he was going for a classic romance novel set-up and I just hate the genre so much that it ruined the experience? It just feels like such a huge departure from his other novels that I was very disappointed.","The Dogs of Christmas by Bruce Cameron I absolutely adore the *A Dog's Purpose* trilogy, so when I came across Cameron's other canine one-off novel, *The Dogs of Christmas*, I snatched it up quick.

25,books,Do you intentionally avoid sad books (or books over sad topics)?,"Are there people who like reading sad books or is that a really small demographic? (Books like ""White Oleander,"" ""Speak,"" ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"" ""The Reader,"" etc. –– these examples are the 'famous' ones in the sad genres but I feel sad books in general might not be as popular). What do you think? If you've been told a book is really sad and over a sensitive topic, would you still read it?

Update: From the responses, I feel there's \~3 types of readers. Those who read purely for fun/escape (no sad books), those who read for philosophical/thoughtful purposes (to better understand world warts and all), and those who read for connection/cathartic reasons (book that resonates with their own life experience or to help them through a hard time in their own life). I would think most readers would read for the first reason, and the last two would be more into sad books.

I've also always wondered how Ian McEwan became so successful when most of his early writing was all sad. ","Do you intentionally avoid sad books (or books over sad topics)?

27,books,A Journal of Murder: Sadistic Serial Killer Carl Panzram has become one of my favourite writers and I really don't know how to feel about it.,"Usually...Separating the art from the artist is like flicking on a light switch for me. I *never* found difficulty in it, until now. Panzrams OWN letters were published after 40 years of trying (by perhaps his only friend Prison Guard Henry Lesser), and it was published into what I have read today - ""A journal of muder"". Holy fuck could this POS use the english language to create something utterly devastating yet beautiful.

See, I have been used to the usual sexual monsters like Page or Bowie, of course you got that monster Polanski etc. But Carl Panzram - if you don't know was a sadistic homosexual arsonist, child rapist, serial killer and just all around evil demon who ""hated everyone and himself"" Carl is *very* fascinating to a lot of people because in many ways he was a straight up Villain.

I always put him on the same shelf as H.H Holmes. They were both complete products of their time (early 1900s) Now, while Holmes was the eccentric ladies man who dressed well, looked healthy and was seen as very aristocratic who built a literal murder mansion.....Panzaram was (and I quote Podcaster Marcus Parks)  ""The living embodiment of a Nick Cave song""

Think of your bukowski or Waits characters, but they're also sadistic monsters - Thats Carl Panzram. He drifted across the world doing god awful things and why? Because all he had was hate. Now, it must be stated that his upbringing was barbaric. He was gangraped by hobos as a kid and when we found himself in prison? Well remember, this was a time when the civil war wasn't too long ago so violence and punishment back then was on volume 11. 

And a result, the 6ft towering giant monster said - In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arson's and, last but not least, I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all these things I am not in the least bit sorry.""

It feels so weird to inlcude a child rapist and murderer as one of my favourite writers but i can't neurologically look at his writings and not be enjoy myself. *I* just can't. I really really reccomend A journal of Murder if anything about Carl Panzram interests you. Its gritt and delivery is fucking unbelievable. It really is unbelievable. We always think of serial killers as idiotic losers who just couldn't do anything right? Well Carl Panzram could fucking write. And I really don't know how to feel about that. 

#Just gonna just end with some quotes by Carl, Thanks for reading! ; 

*Is it unnatural that I should have absorbed these things and have become what I am today, a treacherous, degenerate, brutal, human savage, devoid of all decent feeling, without conscience, morals, pity, sympathy, principle or any single good trait? Why am I what I am?*

*“I was dumped into a cell without any medical attention or surgical attention whatever. My broken bones were not set. My ankles and legs were not put into a cast. The doctor never came near me and no one else was allowed to do anything for me. At the end of 14 months of constant agony, I was taken to the hospital where I was operated on for my rupture and one of my testicles were cut out….I suffered more agony for many months. Always in pain, never a civil answer from anyone, always a snarl or a curse or a lying, hypocritical promise which was never kept. Crawling around like a snake with a broken back, seething with hatred and a lust for revenge, five years of this kind of life. The last two years and four months confined in isolation with nothing to do except brood. I hated everybody I saw.”*

I'm sure plenty of you have heard about this story but it is new to me and I need to talk about it with somebody!

I was looking up mystery novels to get into - all of this holiday spirit has me craving murder and mayhem - when I came across the wildest wikipedia biography I've read in awhile.

An article pointed me towards ""A Christmas Journey"", which I had never heard of, so I decided to google the author's name to check it out.

Lo and behold, I find out that the critically acclaimed and award winning crime novelist Anne Perry and her best friend, who were 15 at the time, brutally murdered her best friend's mother with a brick just to avoid having to move and potentially be separated. The girls went on to serve 5 years in a prison in New Zealand.... When I tell you my jaw dropped!

I've heard of this crime before but I didn't know that one of the girls went on to write mysteries and live such a rich life. I wonder how much inspiration she draws from the event and how that affects her writing in this genre.

What a wild life to live, and then to go on just calmly writing novels that have had such a warm response from the public.... I can't imagine what that must be like.

34,books,Is it better for the author if I buy with an audible credit or kindle plus whispersync audible which is often cheaper?,"I have a lot more time to listen than read so I'm likely to actually use the audible version.  Lately I've discovered that buying on kindle and getting the audible version too often comes out cheaper than a credit.

Does the author get a much better cut from the kindle version, so that even though I'm paying less they're getting more?   A typical combo split would be about $3.50 to $8 for the kindle plus usually $3.50 for whispersync audible vs $11.65 per extra audible credit or about $16 for the monthly. (Australian dollars).

Does going the kindle + whispersync route count as me buying two copies of the book and benefit the author's sales numbers in a meaningful way?  My guess here is probably not a lot because I am one, not legion. 

I also care some for the fortunes of good narrators but the majority of the credit has to go to the author.","Is it better for the author if I buy with an audible credit or kindle plus whispersync audible which is often cheaper?

Its filled with vivid details that paint a crisp picture of the setting. beautiful and philosophical descriptions of nature tied together.

I bought this book from their gift shop, [My Brother Pablo](https://i.imgur.com/PgzrsLW.jpeg) which is an English translation of the same book they were selling in Spanish, Mi Hermano Pablo. It is written by Pablo Escobar's brother.

I've read the whole thing, and the quality of the copy-editing and translation in this book is... well... atrocious. It's so bad that I couldn't understand who would publish a book in this state. The translation is OK, but there are so many errors of every kind (accent/character encoding/printing errors, errors such as ""the the"", grammatical errors, and so on).

It made me want to find more information about the book, but I can't find anything on it by searching for the [ISBN that they give in the front of the book](https://i.imgur.com/K96MbqQ.jpeg). Is this a fake ISBN? Why would it not show up anywhere on the internet or in an [ISBN search](https://isbnsearch.org/search?s=848280536-4)?

I loved, loved, loved the book. The show so far is falling flat for me. It's moving so slowly and it's focusing on elements that were NOT the reasons I loved the book. The show has been really heavy on character development, character flashbacks, the traveling theater troupe, but to me, what made the book was all the small details about the onset and results of the pandemic, the descriptions and feeling of the whole world and what it was like. 

Episode 3 could have taken place entirely in a world without the pandemic. Why did they do a whole episode on Miranda and Arthur's history? By the time the book really gets going, they're both dead. Yes, she wrote the comic book, but again, that was such a minor detail in the book for me.

46,books,Do you ever wonder about the future of fiction?,"I sometimes wonder what kinds of books will be written 20, 30, 50, or 100 years from now. I think the best books I've read have a timelessness about them, some of which were written before I was born. They talk about love of friends or romantic partners, fears of disease and death, and sadness of losing someone you really care about. We can all relate to these.

Books with existential themes, in particular, really speak to me. And I can't imagine authors writing in, say, 2100, will not feel the need to address these life and death concerns. Unless, of course, we find the ""cure"" for death and become immortal. Of course, just because the theme is the same, it does not mean the authors' approach will be the same. I mean older books that talk about existentialism are often quite religious or are written by an author reacting to religion. But our world is becoming less religious, at least in terms of societal institutions (think of the power of church in the Middle Ages vs now). Perhaps technological advances in the future will make even producing books so very different that the content will reflect that. Maybe living in a technologically advanced society or in an increasingly dangerous environment (think more and more frequent or serious pandemics) will affect what authors write about.

47,books,A list of self help books that I’ve read that actually work.,"Hey friends, so I’m making a short list of self help books. There are a LOT of self help books and a lot of people miss the point of them. 

Your self help reading is supposed to be a phase for what you want to do next, it’s not supposed to be a constant in your life where you are looking for the next book to make yourself feel better. 

Mind you, you don’t just go through this phase once. It can happen multiple times and you can find yourself coming out of dark places after reading. 

Let’s start with the toughest cookie. 


Navigating corporate and the court of life 

48 laws of power - it’s unfortunate that we live in a world where this is required reading to get ahead. But this book and what is in it is the difference between becoming Elon Musk or Martin Eberhard. 

The laws of human nature - we humans aren’t perfect. The internet and interacting with a multitude of new people every day at university taught me that people in general ….are flawed. 

One’s own craft 

Atomic habits - if you have ADHD, you need to read this book multiple times. 

Mastery - Nearly everything today is a get rich quick scheme or a scam. Instagram and social media are always telling us how we need to seek attention. This book puts in to perspective what you should really do. 

Relationships and friendships

How to talk to anyone - This book is what How to Win friends and influence people should have been. How to win friends and influence people is a book made for trust fund babies or people who already have leverage or resources. If that isn’t you, the road to getting leverage armed with this book makes things easier. 

The art of seduction - what I like about this book is that everyone picking it up hopes it’s a guide to getting into a girls pants or scoring a man. It’s actually more of Dungeons and Dragons classes if Dungeons and Dragons classes were the types of people who are successful in relationships with examples of said classes.

Mental Health

Feeling good : the new mood therapy - a book that utilizes cognitive therapy is often one I keep coming back to. 

The science of high self esteem - this book saved me from committing suicide during a depression. Just read it.","A list of self help books that I’ve read that actually work.

The thing is, What Alice Forgot is an AMAZING story with really interesting, fleshed out characters, cute kids, and it has a great mystery. The premise is an instant hook and the writing delivers. It should be a hit, right?

Well...the sister though. 

There is this whole subplot where the main character's sister Elizabeth is writing a journal for her doctor about her struggles with infertility and her general sadness in life. It really stops the story dead and doesn't relate to the main events of the book very much. I want to stress, I feel no annoyance toward the subject matter itself (infertility, sadness), but...it should have been its own book. It didn't fit into the storyline and it just felt like Liane wrote it because she felt the need to always provide multiple POVs in her books. And usually the different POVs are awesome, but this book should have just been the ONE POV from Alice.

And since the book is about memory loss, this would be the perfect book to be Liane's only one-POV story, because not reading anyone else's thoughts would increase the feeling of loneliness and confusion and mystery for Alice and the reader.

(The last time I read this I was learning Doric and it was twelve years ago, and my attention was on the text as a work to translate into English vs reading and enjoying it as literature.) Anyway, this is to say I was pretty far into the novel before I realized exactly what part of the Odyssey connected to what I was reading. I mean for as trite a descriptor I would have to say this is rather a lush and evocative tale, from her point of view.

I can't wait to see what happens next, after dinner. I have to say, you all were 1000% correct about this novel! Thanks!"

63,books,Jack Reacher books and their author Lee Child (James Dover Grant CBE),"I've always enjoyed these books but only recently really begun to dig in seriously. In the last couple of months I've gone through almost all of them and it's been entertaining and informative.

First of all I know it's not great literature. The character Jack Reacher is fundamentally unrealistic even though I've known people similar to him. Even the baddest bad ass knows that there is someone badder. Even the most self sufficient loner looks for some kind of attachment eventually. Even a drifter with no steady form of income has to file his taxes or get in trouble eventually.

But unrealistic or not he is a finely crafted fiction and I think most men and a lot of women will understand why. What a perfect fantasy to be like him. How marvelous it would be to be an adult with no responsibilities to anyone. How perfect it would be to have the kind of freedom he enjoys. It really speaks to me and even if JR is unrealistic it gets me thinking about what in my life I could change to be happier.

JDG is a very good writer. Sometimes I catch him repeating a phrase too often in one book but I lay that on the editors. For the most part he's really good at writing in a consistent voice and keeping his stories interesting.

But what I've come to admire most about these books is how fundamentally the same they are. The basic formula repeats over and over and that really ought to be boring. To have your protagonist again and again blunder into these situations with true monsters causing or threatening terrible mayhem and have him be the only person capable of defeating them, and somewhere along the way bumping into the perfect woman who basically falls in and out of love with him over the 2nd half of the book. He does those things over and over and it never gets old. The author finds new ways to suck me into that same scheme over and over. Over and over I put down one of these books and can't wait to pick up the next. I've got 4 left and I know it's going to be tough not having any more.","Jack Reacher books and their author Lee Child (James Dover Grant CBE) I've always enjoyed these books but only recently really begun to dig in seriously.

67,books,How much would I miss out by reading Shakespeare at basically face value?,"I really like Shakespeare, but I find it difficult to start one of his plays.

I tried once and basically knew the entire story top to bottom and nothing was left for me to think about. Then if you’re cross-referencing his hard to define words with what they actually mean, it takes you out of the flow of just enjoying the language he uses. 

I kind of like the idea of going into a play blind and reading it as it comes, seeing what I get out of it. But I tried it once and I read a summary afterwards and realized I had semi-majorly misinterpreted part of the plot. Yet I still got something out of it, I enjoyed just reading the way he wrote and placed his words together.

Just wanted to see if doing prep work and grounding yourself in the world of the play before even starting is more recommended than just going at it blindly and seeing what you like about it","How much would I miss out by reading Shakespeare at basically face value?

Some key points which i loved about the book i would like to share with you all are here... 

1. What exactly the mind is?
This book clearly looks into the depth of what is this thing we call as mind and how it functions. It helped me understand that mind is just a collection of informatiom which we gather from outside and then it just keeps processing it.

2. Mind is my own tool so I must take charge of it.
I never paid attention to the point that my own mind has been creating so many overwhelming negative thoughts just because i had no charge of it. I didn't know how to use it properly. The book gave me the insight on how everything in the mind is just created by ourselves so at least it must go the way we want it to go.

3. How can you take charge of your mind?
Of course after discussing the problem we all want solutions so the book also has some techniques through which we can begin to take charge of our mind and be more productive.

It helped me grow internally and the overthinking process which was creating anxiety and sorrow in my mind is much more reduced now. The more i become aware of it, the more i am able to handle the situations around me with ease.

74,books,Amateur Book Review: Chouette by Claire Oshetsky,"Obligatory english is not my native language (I'm chinese) so if this post is a bit rambly or jumpy so sorry\~

  
*“It’s  a wonder that any woman ever agrees to be a mother, when the fruits of  motherhood are inevitably conflict and remorse, to be followed by death and disembowelment.”* \- Chouette

Chouette is a fantastical, dark, book about motherhood, but where it shines is that it avoids general flowery descriptions of birth, or veer too deeply into metaphors. It instead shows motherhood through the lens of Tiny, our protagonist, who sees the world through a less than ""normal"" perspective, having a baby with her owl lover. She wishes the baby to be brought up ""as she is"", while her husband totters between repulsion at the strange baby or desperately seeking medical cures for her.

Oshetsky nails the themes of motherhood, the isolation and depression from being left at home with a baby, the inability to see the flaws and often spoiling of the child, the sacrifice of the mother's career and health, and finally the heartbreak when the child grows up and no longer needs the mother's care and advice.

In my own experience, the book reads similarly to Kafka's Metamorphosis, peppered with even more fantastical scenes such as where her giant owl lover tears into a shop and asks her if she would like to abort the child. Some scenes may be at once obvious to the reader where it is a figment of her imagination, and some not. Overall I loved this book, and did not regret picking it up at the bookstore. What a sensational debut!

I’ve noticed that I’ll be reading and realize I’ve been thinking about something else for the last 4-5 pages and when I try to remember what I read I obviously can’t and so I re-read those pages and I’m thinking of something else.

Usually it’s something I’ve read that triggers a thought and the thought becomes the tangent.

Maybe I should get back into meditation.","Overthinking distracting from reading? Anyone else have trouble overthinking while reading?

80,books,Praise for Amber spyglass,"What a journey, what a way to tell a story.

His dark materials has been a great read; it is right up my alley in terms of genre but what made the last book stand out to me was the hugely imaginative world(s) that Pullman takes the reader through.

I liked the first book, loved the second and was therefore apprehensive about whether this last book could continue the upwards trajectory. Also I had heard things about the third book not being quite as good. The reason why I loved the second book was because it changed the formula up with a new protagonist and may new ideas and concepts. The Amber spy glass does this again which is part of the reason I loved it and the series  as a whole - in just three books there is a significant transition in story tone and perspective which make for a much more interesting and varied read than similar series.

The changes in this third book are mainly an increase in scale, there are so many new perspectives and characters (and worlds). I thought that Pullman did not underestimate his audience (which really is YA/children) by increasing the scale and maturing the tone of the story. A highlight for me is one point where one protagonist is trying to rescue the other from the ""baddie"" of the previous books with the help of an armoured polar bear while also using a knife to cut through into other realities to also move within the over world. Meanwhile the ""baddie"" has abandoned the church ""worse baddies"" creating a third faction, while a fourth faction arrive to fight the church faction. A battle ensues between the two larger factions: between African secular warriors in helicopters and zealous swiss guards in zeppelins. So naturally, some spies, miniature people who fly on the backs of giant dragon flies, leave battle to help the protagonists and take them back to the secularists. The story then continues from there, but for me this sequence was full to the brim of ideas, action and imagination that I was quite blown away.

The writing in general is nothing  too esoteric, but there are sections of crafted dialogue where really mature themes are discussed which again makes me rate this series so much higher than other similar YA series in enjoyment and how much the author trusts that his audience can grasp these things.","Praise for Amber spyglass What a journey, what a way to tell a story.

81,books,My 2022 Reading Challenge Book List," For my 2022 reading challenge I have decided to read 1-3 books from every country in the world. This past year I attempted to do the same but the lack of preparation meant I was bogged down finding and waiting for books. Below is my reading list I have compiled as several people have mentioned they were interest.

**Facts**

It contains 520ish books with two countries I still need to find something for. 40% are female, 55% are male, and 5% are by various authors. There is a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. It includes everything from memoirs, cookbooks, histories, anthologies, legends, folkstories, poetry, plays, fantasy, romance, chick-lit, and scifi. The bulk is literary fiction. 

**Methodology**

I started with the books I owned that I haven't read or wish to reread. I then looked through my TBR list on goodreads and reassigned those. From there I looked up my favorite authors on https://www.literature-map.com/, and included other authors similar to my favorites. From there I googled each country for their top 1-2 most popular authors. I finished with suggestions from reddit (including the country threads on r/books) and the amazing https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/ . Authors with unlisted titles are because I was not able to find a copy of any book by the author at my library or for purchase (&lt;7$) secondhand. These will need to be ILL  and I’ll be deciding on the exact title when I apply for the loan. 

**Updates**

I will be updating reviews of the books, as I go, on a subreddit I made for this called r/worldwidebooks . People are welcome to join me in the challenge for all of them, parts, or just to laugh.

* Sir Noel Robert Malcolm, Kosovo, A history","My 2022 Reading Challenge Book List  For my 2022 reading challenge I have decided to read 1-3 books from every country in the world. This past year I attempted to do the same but the lack of preparation meant I was bogged down finding and waiting for books. Below is my reading list I have compiled as several people have mentioned they were interest.

**Facts**

It contains 520ish books with two countries I still need to find something for. 40% are female, 55% are male, and 5% are by various authors. There is a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. It includes everything from memoirs, cookbooks, histories, anthologies, legends, folkstories, poetry, plays, fantasy, romance, chick-lit, and scifi. The bulk is literary fiction. 

**Methodology**

I started with the books I owned that I haven't read or wish to reread. I then looked through my TBR list on goodreads and reassigned those. From there I looked up my favorite authors on https://www.literature-map.com/, and included other authors similar to my favorites. From there I googled each country for their top 1-2 most popular authors. I finished with suggestions from reddit (including the country threads on r/books) and the amazing https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/ . Authors with unlisted titles are because I was not able to find a copy of any book by the author at my library or for purchase (&lt;7$) secondhand. These will need to be ILL  and I’ll be deciding on the exact title when I apply for the loan. 

**Updates**

I will be updating reviews of the books, as I go, on a subreddit I made for this called r/worldwidebooks . People are welcome to join me in the challenge for all of them, parts, or just to laugh.

83,books,Hype around The Savage Detectives,"⚠️ warning: personal opinions ahead

&lt;rant&gt;

When I turned the final page I wondered why I even bothered with it at all. What's the point of a complex, globe-spanning, decades-spanning collection of 100 characters' interweaving stories if there is no purpose? An impressive feat with no payoff. It's like if you baked the world's largest and most intricate cake but you didn't add sugar so there is no real point in eating it. When I reached the enormous list of poets' names (which insists on taking up 3 pages) I considered just leaving the damn book on the train (but decided against it, purely out of fear that some unlucky soul would pick it up and decide to read it). There is one vague whisper of a central goal (the search for the missing poet), which is the primary focus of the last 100 or so pages, but when I reached the so-called climax I had to put down the book just to laugh at how stupid the resolution to that plotline turned out to be. This book is too long, too self-indulgent, and too directionless.

The terminal list

My problem is I've forgotten most or part of the books. Is there somewhere I can get a detailed account of what happened in a book to remind me of the main characters and where they are in the story. 

If the winds of winter ever gets released I'd like a overview of the last 2 books instead of reading them again so I know what's happening starting the new book instead of trying to remember who a character was or why they are in a certain place. Rereading the whole series isn't an option as I don't have the time and will get bored as I'll remember most of the books as I'm reading them.

Any googling I've done has given me the synopsis that's on the back of the book which isn't enough. Hopefully someone else with a terrible memory has an answer for me.","Question about going back to finish a series after an extended time.

It explores the history of chemistry and physics discoveries in the early 20th century, going from cyanide to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, mixing in increasingly more fiction and telling a story that makes you question whether all this discovery is ultimately worth it.

My doubt comes from the fact that many of Perrault's known children stories aren't actually original creations of his, but instead transcripts of folk and popular oral spread stories that he compilated and massified amongst the French nobility.

92,books,Upgrade by Blake Crouch,"I'm a huge fan of Blake Crouch's writings. From the thrilling action of his early books to the twisted horror of the Pines trilogy and his most recent hard sci-fi Like Dark Matter and Recursion. It looks like his next book titled Upgrade is staying in the Sci-fi realm. Here's a description:

An ordinary man undergoes a startling transformation—and fears that all of humanity may be next—in the mindblowing new thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of Dark Matter and Recursion

Logan Ramsay can feel his brain…changing.

And his body too.

He’s becoming something other than himself. Maybe even something other than human.

As he sets out to discover who did this to him, and why, his transformation threatens everything—his family, his job, even his freedom.

Because the truth of what’s happened to him is more disturbing than he could possibly imagine. His DNA has been rewritten with a genetic-engineering breakthrough beyond anything the world has seen—one that could change our very definitions of humanity.

And the battle to control this unfathomable power has already begun.

But what if humankind’s only hope for survival lies in embracing this change—whatever the cost?

Which side will Logan take? And by the time it’s over, will he—and the people he loves—even recognize him?

Upgrade is a stunningly inventive, ferociously plotted science-fiction thriller that explores the limits of our humanity—and asks what’s at risk when technology lets us reengineer not just the world around us, but ourselves.","Upgrade by Blake Crouch I'm a huge fan of Blake Crouch's writings.

Key Question: If the main goal in reading books is improvement / problem solving, etc. How do you think it is better to read in English or in your native (Lithuanian) language? Cons: Harder to get / more expensive / longer if you search the library / rare books are not translated.

Pros: since I live in Lithuania, I communicate mostly in Lithuanian and with Lithuanians, I think (mostly) in Lithuanian and reading books would be more of a means to me than a way to spend my free time in my mother tongue.

94,books,Wondering about your thoughts on the second culture book by Ian m. Banks (culture series),Why does anyone enjoy the player of games knowing that the main character is a cheat. He is already the best and yet decides to cheat just to get a better win thus causing the rest of the story. In my mind he is pathetic and he should have just killed himself if he was willing to stupe so low as to cheat when he is almost certain to win. It just makes the rest of the book pointless because i hate the character and i want him to lose. He even says if he gets caught he will end himself its just stupid to destroy any semblance of goodwill towards the main character before he is even 20 percent through the book. Its like tiger woods or kobe cheating to beat a talented amature.,Wondering about your thoughts on the second culture book by Ian m.

95,books,Survivor- Chuck Palahniuk (How to approach Palahniuk?),"Hello, I apologize in advance if this post is hard to follow. I just finished Survivor and my brain is rattling in my skull. I like Palahniuk, and I enjoyed reading this entry.  However I need assistance on how to approach these books. 

I have often seen praise for this particular entry by Palahniuk fans, yet I think this my least favorite that I’ve read so far(Rant, Pygmy, Choke, Survivor). I felt like the book was trying to get one message across, but in the last 70 pages everything kind of got jumbled together. There are many comments about religion, celebrity culture, sex and power, etc. (all that I understand and I think was pretty good and hilarious at times). But when it comes to themes of free will, accepting our fate, actually living life (not on  a strict schedule), and being focused on the end I feel as though things were jumbled and the greater message was sort of lost in translation. I thought it could have been executed better. The story itself was entertaining though. I just thought it never really followed through with the message, and the book tried too hard to have a wild plot. 

**Am I not approaching these books correctly?** Should I just treat it as a comedy/thriller and not necessarily focus on the greater meaning? I thought there were a lot of good tidbits, but as a whole it didn’t really work as well as I thought it had the potential to. 

I would appreciate any feedback, opinions, insight, advice, etc. Anything would help. Again I’m sorry if this is hard to follow, the book broke my brain.","Survivor- Chuck Palahniuk (How to approach Palahniuk?) Hello, I apologize in advance if this post is hard to follow.

First, the angsty attitude is bleeding from every pore of the book.  Honestly I can't really call this is a negative because I don't remember being particularly annoyed by it when I initially read it.  To be fair, the book is written for a 2009 pre-teen/young teen, so the cringe-inducing vibe is forgivable.

The real issue - Within about 10 pages of the book they mention that Zoe is Native American. I immediately looked up the authors and saw that they were older white people.   Figured then that this series is likely to be wildly offensive and stereotypical about Native American culture.

98,books,Mirrorland review,"Took me a while to digest this book and I have to say I really enjoyed it. It’s hard to give a good review without any particular spoilers so I will do my best!

It’s about a woman who has is an identical twin and because of very specific breaches to their relationship they live as of the other sister does not exist and a shady past that ties them together .
She gets word that her sister is missing and she has to travel back to Scotland to help find her. Back to the past that she ran from, and the house where it all began. 
What’s great about this story is that the majority of this book takes place in a very old house and the house and it’s rooms become a main character in the story. I love books that do that! This home where the twin girls grew up and left under mysterious circumstances had a secret room in which they named Mirrorland.
What’s phenomenal about this book is that it flips between the present and the past in a dream like way where you feel like your there. The story had a surprising ending and there was so many twists in the second half of the book that I felt like I had to stay up and finish it because I just had to know how it ended. 
And the ending is perfect, I love books that give closure after putting you through the emotional ringer for 300+ pages.

Without giving too much away there are definitely trigger warnings here in this story for physical abuse, rape and incest.

99,books,Go read “The Inheritance Games”,"I just have to give this book and Jennifer Lynn Barnes major props. It’s YA and I don’t have a single complaint (this is only regarding the first book, as it’s a trilogy. I’m currently on the second book, so I can’t speak for the ending of the series as a whole, as the third book comes out late 8/30/2022). 

I tend to only read adult thrillers and mystery and out of the last five books I’ve read, four have had major questions and plot holes that didn’t make any sense (the books were survive the night, the guest list, verity, and the wife between us). I found that in those books, there were plot lines that didn’t make sense to the overarching plot and were just there to throw the reader, which I find infuriating and insulting. 

When I finished the inheritance games, I did not have a SINGLE thought like that. Not one. I just have to applaud Jennifer Lynn Barnes for how thoroughly she thought out this plot, especially because it’s all about puzzles and that makes it very easy to slip up. Any time I had a thought “but what about _____”, it was addressed in the next paragraph. I read about her and it seems she’s quite brilliant. She has advanced degrees in psychology, psychiatry, and cognitive science, including graduate degrees from Cambridge (where she was a Fullbright scholar), and a PhD from Yale. She’s also an associate professor at the university of Oklahoma in psychology and professional writing. I’m tremendously impressed!! 

This book is very fun and clever. It has major “Knives Out” vibes. I read it’s being made into an Amazon series (it would be a sin to not put this on TV or the big screen, it’s perfect for that). I give it five stars (I’m very stingy with my stars) and couldn’t recommend it enough!!","Go read “The Inheritance Games” I just have to give this book and Jennifer Lynn Barnes major props.

100,books,J.K. Rowling and Terry Pratchett on Equal Rites,"I just finished **Equal Rites** by Terry Pratchett and couldn't help but notice the similarities between the setting and characters in **Equal Rites** and the Harry Potter Universe. **Equal Rites** was published in 1987 and the first HP book came a decade later in 19997. Of course, everybody has their inspirations, but I've looked all around and can't find J.K. Rowling ever talking about **Equal Rites**?   


Here are some of my notes on the the similarities:

* Unseen University and Hogwarts both are described as having a Great Hall - a grandiose room that acts as the centerpiece for the buildings.
* The antagonists in **Equal Rites** are called The Things and are described as ghost like apparitions with eyeless voids and who take over your body in a soul-sucking kind of way. Sort of like... you know... dementors.
* Simon is a lanky teen wizard whose primary, external character trait is that he stutters  *\*Cough Cough Nevil Longbottom\**
   * A character who ends up being a crucial savior.
* Lower-class laundry workers for the castle.
   * Readers of **Goblet of Fire** will understand this one.

Of course, as I stated above, influences and coincidences are to be expected of any writer (especially with all the similar trappings of genre-fiction), but I just found these connections interesting.

I haven't been able to find any procedures for this but maybe I 'm just not good enough at searching.

I imagine you'd need fairly high temperatures for the reaction to happen. Also probably want a solvent that can dissolve both reactants to at least some extent, maybe something like DMF which can dissolve both and has a high boiling point?

118,chemistry,Enforcing purity of drinking water.,"Where I live, the tapwater is supposed to be ""excellent"", which may well be the case, but I sure don't trust the pipes to my house in particular are ""excellent"".

Buying bottled water is back to playing the quality control lottery.

So I had an idea: if I run my water through a reverse osmosis filter, the absence of contaminants should be relatively easy to verify with a resistance measurement. Of course this doesn't cover non-conductive contaminants, but then the reverse osmosis filter would have to filter out the conductive contaminants, and leave the non-conductive ones which is unlikely. Unfortunately, de-ionised water is supposed to taste bad, which leads me to my next question - can I add something to my de-ionised water that is healthy, and makes it taste ""normal"" again?","Enforcing purity of drinking water.

For example, I might give them a dilution of rose oxide to smell, then a Gewurztraminer wine to taste to help make the ""rose"" connection in the wine.

Most of these molecules are used in food or perfume so it's easy to find toxicity/safety info on them.

But there's one molecule in particular that I'm interested in that occurs in some Riesling wines called [TDN (CAS: 30364-38-6)](https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical/executive-summary/DTXSID30184443) that hasn't really been studied for use in scent/foods so there aren't as much safety guidelines. That said, people drink Riesling all the time without anything bad happening, and the concentration of TDN in these wines is known.

So my question is basically: If I take this molecule and dilute it down to a similar level as it occurs in wine, then use that dilution to make scent samples (not for ingestion or skin contact), would that be safe?

This isn't a legal/regulation question. I just wanted to double check my thinking with some chemists and make sure I'm not making any false assumptions that might put people at risk.","Safety of TDN molecule (found in Riesling wine) I host a wine tasting group and I sometimes give members smell samples of isolated molecules that occur in wine to help them understand common ""notes.""

155,chemistry,Theoretical limits in formulas,"(stupid questions inbound)

&amp;#x200B;

Referring to the synthesis reaction: A + B -&gt; AB

Is there any theory that addresses the limits of how to express this equation?

""A"" refers to the 1st chemical formula, ""B"" refers to the 2nd chemical formula, ""AB"" is the 3rd chemical formula which encompasses all elements of the 1st and 2nd chemical formula.

Conventionally, each reacting chemical formula of a synthesis reaction includes only one chemical element. Therefore, the produced chemical formula includes only two elements.

Is there a defined maximum amount of elements a reacting chemical formula of a synthesis reaction can hold?

This would also mean there is a defined maximum amount of elements the produced chemical formula of a synthesis reaction can hold, and subtracting the defined maximum amount of elements a reacting chemical formula of a synthesis reaction can hold FROM the maximum amount of elements a produced chemical formula of a synthesis reaction can hold would give us the maximum amount of elements the secondary reacting chemical formula of a synthesis reaction can hold.

The resulting equation representing this reaction would be what I like to call the ""limit equation"":

as if you add anything more to it, it would no longer be considered a synthesis reaction.

This leads me to bigger questions: 

\-What are the rules used to classify a reaction under ""Synthesis reaction""? 

\-If there is a bigger system of conventional rules used to classify reactions under certain labels, where can I see it?","Theoretical limits in formulas (stupid questions inbound)

This is real problem that affects several towns. New unknown gas started to appear from water heated by ""boiler"" (storage water heater)

Storage water heater

the temperature is supposedly between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius,

water is there motionless for at least 8 hours at night,

there is magnesium anode there.

Input cold water contains

""total chlorine"" below 0.5 ppm,

zero ""free chlorine"",

zero NH3, zero NH4,

has acrid smell ( like chloramine ).

The water comes from some ""water treatment plant"" ( technology unknown ). Water treatment plant takes water from the long river that goes through agricultural area and the ""tight sand gas"" field, gas extraction started recently.

At the output from ""boiler"" the water recently started to contain the  highly volatile gas with strange smell that difficult to describe, the  gas **immediately** causes the sensation of load and small  pain in the forehead ( frontal sinus ? ) I notice almost nothing when I  take shower but I immediately notice this gas when I wash my hands (  when I am above the tap ).

I tried to read the articles about the storage water heater and see  there the information about trihalomethanes but they need the free  chlorine as I understood but my tests show zero free chlorine so now I  don't know where to look for.","Storage water heater - unknown reaction

Went out with a friend for the day and came back to this influx of encouragement! I'm really thankful for everyone's comments its made my day :)

Edit: to the person who Pm'd me I'm sorry I accidentally clicked the ignore pop-up and don't know how to undo it but thank you for the words of encouragement!

I'm a current college sophomore who took general chemistry this semester out of an interest to do medicine. Throughout High School, I've generally gotten A's and high B's, but have always struggled with multiple-choice test-taking. On top of that, due to the pandemic, I did my first year of college completely online so this was my first semester in-person. To say the least, it threw me into a whirlwind.

I got a 75% on my first chemistry exam of the semester, and it just went lower and lower from there. I did everything I could from booking multiple peer tutoring appointments through my university to having a meeting with my professor. It got to a point where I was neglecting my other classes and completely focusing on chemistry. I even paid for exam reviews and mock exams from a local test-prep service. I remember the night before the final exam I spent 24 hours in the building my exam would take place at, studying and taking mock exams. I would take naps in between so I wasn't groggy during the Final. I walked into the exam room never having felt more confident and self-assured. The first few questions were easy, then one by one I realized the material on the Final didn't reflect what I studied. They were purely concept-based, and I had 45 mins down the clock ticking. As I went through the paper I could feel my confidence slipping. I had watched organicchemistrytutor on youtube, took practice tests, created in-depth notes and study material.

Never had I felt so utterly stupid and useless as I realized I would have to guess on these questions as the time continued to slip. The next day the results came out and I got a 50%, barely passing the class. I feel so stupid for not withdrawing from this class when I had the chance, thinking I could salvage my grade by the end of the semester. I never in my wildest dreams expected to get a D. My GPA has tanked, and I feel like giving up on medicine, maybe a D in this class is a sign that I'm not cut out for this. I've lost a lot of respect for myself and I don't know what to do from here. It's less of the fact that I got a D, but more-so the fact that despite putting in my everything I got a D. I spent a whole 5 months obsessing and stressing over this class for it all to go to waste.","I got my first D in my educational career thus far in general chemistry...i don't know what to do anymore Edit: Wow I didn't expect to get such a huge response but I feel a lot better now!

198,chemistry,Career prospects,"Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a second year undergrad Chem major and I'm contemplating whether I should finish the degree or switch to something else. 

(Backstory: I decided to major in Chem because I like it. I think it's fun and more easy to understand than the other sciences such as physics or bio. I never really thought about the career prospects/ grad school when I applied.)

The main reason why I'm contemplating switching is because of the lack of career prospects (?). From what I've read online, it seems that with a bachelor's in Chem, you can't really do much besides work in a low level lab or if you want a better job, go to grad school.  

I'm not sure if i want to go to grad school so is there anything else you can do with a bachelors in Chem? To those with Chem degrees, would you say that it's required to go to grad school to get a good (well paying) job? Should I just finish the degree because I like Chem and see where it goes from there? 

Any insight/opinions would be helpful :)

205,CryptoTechnology,Open source crypto projects to participate,"Hey guys, 

i would like to deepen my coding skills, and would appreciate a promising new open source crypto/blockchain project, where hands-on work is required. Ideally, i would like to increase my knowledge of C++. I have no prior expertise in Rust, but would like to learn it anyway, therefore Rust would probably also be fine.

If there are some interesting open source crypto/blockchain projects, that come to your mind, i would appreciate your input :D

Hopefully, i did exceed the word count now, that is required to post here, but with this sentence it should be fine :D","Open source crypto projects to participate Hey guys,

206,CryptoTechnology,Non-static dWebsites using ENS?,"Hello, I was looking into creating a decentralized website using ENS + IPFS, but it was pointed out that the IPFS CID would change every time I change the content of my files, and so my understanding is that there is no *easy* way to constantly link my ENS to a dWebsite without continually updating the content hash.

There is a way around this, where a link (example.eth.link) would direct to an existing website (example.com), but why not just use the website to begin with? I was wondering if there are any other solutions to this issue.","Non-static dWebsites using ENS?

* Choosing a blockchain platform for your NFTs

There are currently a number of options available, including Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, Binance Smart Chain, EOS, Tron, WAX, Tezos, and Polkadot.

* Open an account on a NFT marketplace

Popular options include OpenSea, Foundation, Nifty Gateway, and SuperRare.

* Creating and linking supported wallet

Popular options include Metamask and Trust Wallet, however, for convenience you can use your a wallet specific to the chosen blockchain (for earning rewards).

* Content creation

Create the asset it will represent. Whether art, music, gifs, emojis, etc, give it your all. Once the creation is complete, you will need to purchase the native cryptocurrency to the blockchain platform that you selected. 

The final stage on how to mint an NFT is to upload one creation or a collection to the NFT platform. You will then need to upload a high-quality representation of your creation and include required information like a name, external links, descriptions, properties, etc.
And that’s it. Your NFT is now available on the marketplace you selected, and can be accessed by anyone using the same platform.","How To Make NFTs - Step-By-Step Guide When it comes to learning how to create a NFT there are a few steps one needs to take.

Any good decentralised video streaming projects worth following?

Can have a system where viewing content can be paid or upvoted with a token. More popular a video is, the more tokens it gets awarded from users. Users will be less inclined to pay to upvote bad content so should improve overall quality of content. 

Can maybe have a system where viewing ads earns tokens or paying tokens removes ads (similar to BAT).

215,CryptoTechnology,Pros and Cons to gov voting on blockchain,"So we all know there is a hard push for voting for political people to be on blockchain. But many are pushing as it is a cure all, when it isn't. And the other side is pushing as it's pointless when it's very much needed.

# How would it work?

There would have to be a way the person votes. This can include current or future methods. This could include everyone having a hardware wallet and voting the same way in crypto we vote.

From there the votes would have to be place on the blockchain.

# The good

Once it hits the blockchain everything can be verified giving the blockchain is secure. Meaning like we seen in this past president election where we had groups putting the same ballot into a machine many times to pump the votes. Depending on where the vote goes onto the blockchain this won't be possible.

# The problem

1. If the thing that is taking the vote is messed up, then this is a problem. So for example, if we do more mail in ballots, the thing goes to a single place to be put in, and then we can have people scanning ballots over and over. As you can see blockchain can't solve anything in that system. But if the person hits a button or some scanner at a polling location connects directly to the blockchain. Then that won't be a problem, but the device that scans or the thing you pressed the button on if it is messed up then it can be a problem.
2. Another problem is if the gov owns the blockchain or a small blockchain is used. If the gov owns the blockchain the gov can literally flip votes without anyone knowing. If it's a small blockchain then it can easily get attacked.

# The solution

For mail in ballots, hardware wallets could be used. I honestly think your citizen identification card will be a hardware wallet in the future. Note this doesn't completely solve the problem because what if the hardware wallet is compromised before you get it. But for the here and now, what could happen is instead of mailing in the ballot. Much of it will require the person to physically go to a DMV, post office, library, or some other secure building to pick up their hardware wallet. From here the person can use it at their house, and they can return it. Or if it's a really remote place without internet then there could a be a secure device the person can pick up that can't be edited once scanned. The person would just need to send back the device for their vote to be counted.","Pros and Cons to gov voting on blockchain So we all know there is a hard push for voting for political people to be on blockchain.

224,CryptoTechnology,"Web 3.0 private blockchains and how I think they will work (like for the gov) (layer 1 2 &amp; 3), and how running a type of crypto on it could eliminate the need of traditional taxes","So going along with my prior post on Web 3.0 on here. Yes I think private blockchains will heavily be used simply for the improvements of a blockchain vs a normal cloud storage system. Like a blockchain requires many points of failures while a normal cloud system only requires a single point of failure. 

I can easily foresee in this new age of Web 3.0 we will see things like the USA gov have it's own blockchain. What could happen is the federal gov will make a layer 1 blockchain. 

For those of you who don't know Layer 1 blockchain is simply the first level. Layer 2 is what is built on layer 1. Layer 3 is built on layer 2. And so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I can see it where the federal will have layer 1, and each federal department and each state is layer 2. Then layer 3 will be built on the state level for state programs, counties, and most likely cities. (It is possible some states or all might pick to make city level layer 4 and 5).

The smaller the blockchain the easier it is to attack. So having layer 1 gov blockchain be controlled by federal gov USA or something like the UN which branches off. It makes it more secure from changing files. And then top that with privacy stuff which helps hide where things are being transferred or what is being transfer. 

# How crypto on top of this could get away from normal taxes?

So IMO if a gov power was to do something like this, at this time it would be smart to look at switching their currency to heavily backed by crypto and a solid push for getting away from physical money. What I could see is the gov could use the same features on the newer coins in which everyone gets reflections as the crypto is being used.

Reflections are basically a transfer tax from the crypto itself. Say it's 10% for example, and you bought something for $100. That's $10 being taxed. Now lets say there is just 1M coins. That $10 gets split between them all and each gets $0.00001 of that $10. Now lets say if the gov holds 500k coins. This means the gov gets $5 from that tax while everyone else gets everything else.

What this means is since the gov will end up holding a huge back. For every transfer, buy, sell, or whatever. They should in theory get enough from that which would make normal taxes pointless. Plus it would encourage the gov to push for a better economy and for the gov to spend less so it can have a bigger bag to make more.

BTW sorry for any typo or ramble. It's just my 3AM thoughts on how this tech could work to solve both problems and how I think it could work.","Web 3.0 private blockchains and how I think they will work (like for the gov) (layer 1 2 &amp; 3), and how running a type of crypto on it could eliminate the need of traditional taxes So going along with my prior post on Web 3.0 on here. Yes I think private blockchains will heavily be used simply for the improvements of a blockchain vs a normal cloud storage system. Like a blockchain requires many points of failures while a normal cloud system only requires a single point of failure. 

I can easily foresee in this new age of Web 3.0 we will see things like the USA gov have it's own blockchain. What could happen is the federal gov will make a layer 1 blockchain. 

For those of you who don't know Layer 1 blockchain is simply the first level. Layer 2 is what is built on layer 1. Layer 3 is built on layer 2. And so on.

225,CryptoTechnology,Standards for Web 3.0,"One of the biggest things we need now for Web 3.0 is standards. Basically, guidelines so no matter what blockchain Web 3.0 is on. It in theory should more than less work.

NOTE: If I had to guess I would think we are in ARPANET times if we are to compare it to the normal internet. Or maybe even prior to that. I think we seen nothing when it comes to the full power of Web 3.0.

Here is what I want to see.

1. Sites are NFT. Basically, this comes in 2 fold. The first is the bulk of the info could be stored on private servers or private blockchains. I imagine gov, medical, and so on would want to do that. The other fold is the entire site including pictures, videos, and download files is on the blockchain. It could be multiple NFT and the code points to it like it would point to a picture on a server.  But if you right click this website and click inspect. The code you see and what the browser uses to show you what the owner of the site wants you to see is mostly what will be on the blockchain in both cases.
2. Browsers on Web 3.0 can act as bridges between connected blockchains. Basically, we need standards for browsers to be made which will allow things like NFT to transfer from 1 blockchain to another. And for the browser to adapt and redirect to a new blockchain. I imagine you will see governments using their own blockchain for internal things like taxes. The user shouldn't have to know how to do anymore steps than they need to right now in order to upload a file. In fact, they shouldn't even know if it's on another blockchain unless if they use some inspect or something.
3. We need standards on how blockchains should handle data being transfer from 1 to the other, if the company wants this info public (maybe medical files shouldn't be shown, but already public part void any rights and it will be logged). And the blockchain can point to where the file has been transfer to. And how DNS should handle this.
4. We need standards to note if a site has been changed, and how to handle that and link creation. IMO it should be earmarked when it was edit, but one of the problems we can solve is link rot. Depending on storage abilities, it might be possible to save the text only or some level of a site when a link is made in a special way. What come to mind is legal opinion papers from the Supreme Court in the USA they have a ton of dead links in them. Well, if they used a special way to make the link which preserves the info. And if there was a way to detect when an edit was last made so any future person linking in this special way the blockchain would automatically check and see if another copy needs to be made or if it can use the special link that is already out there.
5. We need standards to handle data overload on blockchains. Even more historical data. My thoughts is this. We seriously need to look at this because there is a lot of historical info we don't want changed due to cyber security problems.
6. We need standards that allow people/sites to auto compress their data and how to handle this.
7. We need standards how to to keep this feeless as possible or completely free.
8. We need standards to figure out what needs to be suggested and what needs to be required to work with Web 3.0
9. We need standards on making domains. I see this most likely being what we have now, but where the part of the blockchain the site is on could permanently get that domain name. This preventing if you don't pay up over time then the site link goes away and link rot problem happens.","Standards for Web 3.0 One of the biggest things we need now for Web 3.0 is standards.

230,CryptoTechnology,My theory on how to handle data for Web 3.0,"So based on my last post it seems like some think forever we won't have large amount of data on the blockchain. Even more if it's useless data. To be blunt, if this is the case forever on then Web 3.0 is dead before it started.

My theory is simple but hard to implement. Right now how blockchain works is all the data on it is mirrored on all nodes. The problem with this is if say I was gov x and wanted to crash or take over a blockchain. I could just spend a bit to load the blockchain with a bunch of useless crap to kill the size. The less nodes that can hold it, the easier it is to do a 51% attack. This making Web 3.0 more than pointless or more dangerous than what we have now.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my theory is we could have a blockchain or update one like ETH where all devices that connect to Web 3.0 will become a node. The device will sacrifice part of the storage to gain access to Web 3.0. So like if you have your phone connect, you might have to give up 100 MB or whatever that YOU as the user can adjust. Now, instead of having all nodes mirror the blockchain, this could be scaleable. So think of it as if we had a million smartphones on Web 3.0 and all have given up 100 MB. What could happen is 1% of that or 10k of those connected smartphones would have the exact same info on it at any given time. They would verify that part of the blockchain between each other and there could be a 51% thing between that. This means per 1M smartphones you would have 100 different copies if each allowed for 100MB to be used.

Now take that idea and instead of having 10k smartphones having a mirror, it's more like a raid system for a NAS. Where you can lose part of the total 1M total load and still have way more than enough redundancy involved where you should be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Note the numbers were for example. That is the hard part in figuring out. And to be honest, it should be dynamic since the more devices the better the system is. But there would also have to be checks to make sure you don't have a ton of the system dependent on single devices. Like Xbox, and having to worry about what if they run into a problem across their single device that uses the exact same chips and software. This stopping possible cyber security problems.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

How the current blockchain system is if we had to compare it to a NAS. It's currently every hard drive is mirroring off of one another. When in reality it needs to be some hybrid raid system down to the point that as long as a device can give up more than 10 MB. It should if it wants to connect to Web 3.0.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# NOTE:

If you can't store all the data on blockchain for Web 3.0 or at least the bulk of it to the point where there is a ton of pointless data. You lose out to almost all benefits of a blockchain. Like without being able to store as much data as we have on the normal internet onto the blockchain. This means we can't solve for link rot, gov can still easily go after things and change things based on where the servers are, and so on.

**So this is a must for Web 3.0 to work, or otherwise we are wasting our time trying to replace the current internet.**

Anyways, as I was going around the yard today I noticed we have a number of objects he made. And I noted how there is only so much I can do to protect them. But what if, I could make 3D scans of the items, and mint the 3D scan + some note to leave with it into an NFT. This preserving a digital model of the items, name, date when it was made, and a few other things I want to attach. And this letting future generations see what this person made and did during their time here.

This got me thinking about this a bit more and what if there was a DAO which you can add anything to an NFT and do whatever. But the DAO will help officially build family tress, and it will link to NFT others made as to show this is what the person did in their life. For people prior you would have to show the DAO evidence somehow that the person on the family tree made/did something said in the NFT. But as time goes on and if the world gets more and more on blockchain. The family tree will link to your wallet to show your digital life and anything you might add. But it will keep the feature prior so if you're in a newspaper someone can submit that to the DAO and it will be linked.

Syscoin is attempting to offer more than other L1s by continuing to maintain the security and decentralisation of PoW network and there are no more secure networks than Bitcoins. By being mergemined with  up to 25% of BTC hash rate it maintains one of the most secure networks on the planet whilst using no extra power at all which means it is also the greenest. In Syscoin 4.3 they have also added chainlocks on the masternode layer to ensure extra security against 51% and MEV meaning it could be classed as the most secure. 

When Ethereum finally pivots to PoS then the devs believe it will again retain the favourism of the majority of developers and other L1s will have to become rollups themselves on other networks to survive. Syscoin will provide an alternative to this by being PoW. 

There will be talks on how zkrollups will effect the buidl mode of next couple of years as we are approaching fully evm compatible rollups.

234,CryptoTechnology,Shifting the paradigm for Dapp development,"Right now there is a massive awakening on what defi is capable of. Opening financial products up to all is a great idea, but as it stands today we are severely limiting the innovation and development that can happen in the space because the tools we have are extremely inadequate.
 
Solidity (and most of the programming languages used for smart contracts today) are general purpose languages - you can build anything with them. But because they’re so generalized, they don’t do a very good job at the one thing that you need most for DeFi and crypto - managing tokens.

In Solidity, tokens are created as a list of account balances (uint256’s) inside an ERC20 smart contract (e.g. account 0x...123 has 50 tokens, 0x...456 has 100 tokens, etc). To execute a token transfer, a message is sent to the contract with instructions to update a particular account’s balance. But because Solidity has no native concept of an asset, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) doesn’t know the difference between a uint256 that represents a token, and a uint256 that represents any other variable. 

Logic around asset behavior, such as the fact that a token shouldn’t be in two places at once, doesn’t exist - the developer has to implement this kind of logic from scratch, for every single contract. It’s like using a swiss army knife to make sushi - sure it can just about do the job, but the sushi gets hacked to pieces. No wonder we see hacks pretty much every week with Solidity smart contracts.

So, what is the right tool for the job? Well first, what is the job? Defi is the big use case for crypto. Handling assets, handling value represented by tokens. So, we need a tool designed from the outset to handle tokens. 

In Scrypto, assets are a native feature of the language. To create a token in Scrypto, you just call a native function directly within the language. For example “.new_token_fixed(1000)” creates a token with a fixed supply of 1000. To transfer the token, you can call on native functions such as “.take(1)”, which takes a single token, or “.send(1)” which sends a single token somewhere. These tokens are guaranteed to behave like physical assets (like a physical coin), as they always have to live in only one place, which makes it way more intuitive.

Being intuitive has two massive upsides. First, it makes it easier, which means the barrier to entry for developers is lower. This will get more devs programming more dapps with less limits on innovation. The second upside is it makes dapps more secure. If you can easily see how assets will behave, you can easily pick out when they're going to misbehave. That makes programming and auditing far easier.

Scrypto is still in development, but the ""alpha"" release, Alexandria, has just come out . This allows it to be run on a private, local (ie offline), instance of the Radix network. Dapps can be developed and tested here, before going live on the real network next year. 

This early release is both to familiarise developers with the new language and mindset, and also for the team to get feedback on any shortcomings that might exist, and how they can be addressed. I'll post a link below if you're interested in diving deeply into this. If you're a developer just starting out, then maybe giving the documentation a look could really help you make your ideas a reality.","Shifting the paradigm for Dapp development Right now there is a massive awakening on what defi is capable of.

243,CryptoTechnology,Verifiable Computing Applications in Blockchain,"Hi,

We have recently published a paper [Verifiable Computing Applications in Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9620108) and I am sharing it here since I think some of you might find it interesting.

In the paper we provide an overview of common methods for verifying computation, such as replication (recomputation), proofs (interactive proofs, zero-knowledge proofs such as zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.), multiparty computation (MPC), verifiable randomness (VRF/VDF), and trusted execution environment (TEE/SGX).

We then group the applications of these verifiable computing techniques into five thematic blockchain areas (secure key management, sybil-resistance and consensus, smart contracts, scalability, and privacy) and discuss how are they used in major blockchain projects today (summary/examples in Table 3 and Table 4).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Abstract**  
&gt;  
&gt;From weak clients outsourcing computational tasks to more powerful machines, to distributed blockchain nodes needing to agree on the state of the ledger in the presence of adversarial nodes, there is a growing need to efficiently verify the results of computations delegated to untrusted third parties. Verifiable computing is a new and interesting research area that addresses this problem. Recently, new applications of verifiable computing techniques have emerged in blockchain technology for secure key management, sybil-resistance and distributed consensus, and smart contracts, while providing desired performance and privacy guarantees. In this paper, we provide an overview of common methods for verifying computation and present how they are applied to blockchain technology. We group the presented verifiable computing applications into five main application areas, i.e., multiparty approval for secure key management, sybil-resistance and consensus, smart contracts and oracles, scalability, and privacy. The main contribution of this survey is to answer two research questions: 1) what are the main application areas of verifiable computing in blockchain technology, and 2) how are verifiable computing techniques used in major blockchain projects today.","Verifiable Computing Applications in Blockchain Hi,

252,CryptoTechnology,Paper vs Hardware Wallets,"Hi Guys,

I have been reading and watching videos about how hardware wallets work and I think I understand the general use case.

My approach to crypto investment is DCA and hold, I buy monthly or biweekly and never sell or trade and I plan to stick to that strategy for the next 3-5 years. 

My balance is all in the DEX and I have accumulated enough assets that it's making me very nervous to keep them there, particularly after the massive hack to BitMart last week. 

So based on my particular use case I am finding hard to understand the benefits of having a hardware wallet over a paper wallet.

If I still need to keep the seed phrases of my hardware wallet somewhere, wouldn't that defeat the purpose? 

If someone steals the seed phrases can't they just get a new hardware and regenerate the private keys? 

I see the benefit of a hardware wallet if I trade often, because I can use my pin to move assets around instead of having to get my paper wallet out of my safe to scan it, which could create a security risk. 

Am I missing something here?

Excuse my ignorance, I'm relatively new to this.","Paper vs Hardware Wallets Hi Guys,

253,CryptoTechnology,What if Layer2 networks (Lightning and Connext) become integrated to launch a DEX | A DEX with near zero fees?,"Layer 2 network refers to a secondary framework or protocol that is built on top of a blockchain system. The main goal of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling difficulties that are being faced by the major cryptocurrency networks. Two popular L2 networks are Lightning and Connext. 
The Lightning Network features a peer-to-peer system for making micropayments of cryptocurrency through a network of bidirectional payment channels without delegating custody of funds.
Connext is a crosschain liquidity network that enables fast, fully-noncustodial transfers between EVM-compatible chains and L2 systems. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain along with groundbreaking distributed systems tech to enable instant, near-free transfers anywhere in the world.

Now, think about of Layer3 networks. Layer3 solutions aim to supercharge distinct blockchains with the cross-chain functionality they need to communicate and interact with each other to achieve true interoperability.

Stakenet is going to launch the first Layer3 native asset multi-chain DEX, by combining Layer 2 protocols (Lightning Network and Connext) to allow practically instant, feeless cross-chain swaps backed by the Stakenet blockchain and powered by its nodes.
The current DEX's are all running on L1 Blockchains but this is not a scaleable solution and returns in a lot of fees for the trader. On the Stakenet DEX trader can rent or Open Lightning and connext channels to trade instant with fees near to zero on an orderbook.

This promising project is going to be released on December 10th. I think that will make a huge change to DEXs.
Its native coin (XSN) is also growing up from now. I'm just waiting for higher growth once the DEX get launched.

I'm just curious what would be something you would trust with the concept of CBDC still in mind."
270,CryptoTechnology,"Could there by a use for ""nondeterministic"" operations determined by block producer?","Suppose for the context some blockchain or something in many ways like a blockchain which has a smart contract instruction set (at least analogous to EVM instruction set, or Bitcoin opcodes I suppose).  

Now, aiui, there are already things even in Bitcoin such that what exactly a transaction does depends on the settings of the miner who mines the block. (I haven't checked whether on Bitcoin one can use this to do things other than just ""send some amount of coins to whatever address the block producer lists as their address"" but, this does at least have some dependency on what the block producer chose.).  

But, my question is whether it could potentially be useful to have instructions which expand this influence substantially (when requested by the code being executed as part of the transaction).  

That is, (now, again thinking more on the ""EVM instructions used in a smart contract"" side of the scale than the ""Bitcoin opcodes"" side of the scale), suppose there was an instruction which would request some number of bytes from the mining software, perhaps with a hint for what kind of source these bytes should be from, which the mining software would insert. These bytes provided by the miner would be included in the block so that others validating the blocks could check that the transaction was executed in a valid way, but there would be no technical restriction on what bytes the miner can provide.  

For example, the smart contract could request untrusted-random bytes from the miner. These would not be trustworthy, because if the miner benefited from manipulating them, well, they can choose them to be whatever they want. But, if the benefit of the randomness is just for efficiency of execution, and having no bearing as to the part of the result which is the point of the smart contract, then if the smart contract+transaction was set up such that the miner was no worse off by providing random bytes than if they manipulated the bytes provided to make the contract run inefficiently, then perhaps miners could be expected to set their mining software to provide random bytes in these cases?

Or, instead, suppose the miner is likely to have access to some information which the smart contract can cheaply verify, but which cannot be cheaply computed by the smart contract, and which requires information that the person sending the transaction does not have at the time that they send the transaction (but which the miner of a block including the transaction would be likely to know. Or, alternatively, which their mining software would be likely to know.)  
Then, the smart contract could request the bytes, check if the bytes provided satisfy the condition, and if so, reward the miner, and if not, abort and quit early (to avoid additional gas fees).

(which type of request is being made could be determined by an additional hint parameter, even though from the perspective of validating a block these two things would be equivalent)


(I was originally thinking of such an operation in the context of many interlinked permission-ed chains, each with a single block producer, but where there are links between the different chains where each chain has associated with it a smart contract on a number of the other chains which holds some collateral which, if presented with proof that the one chain has acted invalidly, gives a payout to make whole the person presenting the proof, but, I thought the concept might also be applicable more broadly, and actually, probably more applicable more generally than in the case I was originally thinking of.  
Note that I'm not claiming that the security of the original thing I was thinking of works out. I'm quite unsure of that. This post isn't meant to advocate for that idea.)

**So, my question:** Do you have any arguments for why this would ""(almost) never be a good instruction to support"" ? Do you see any good use-cases that stand out to you?    

I suppose that if one wants some random bytes and is not concerned whether they can be manipulated by an adversary, then just using the hash of the previous block could suffice for that.  
But, also, if a smart contract set things up such that choosing the ""random"" bytes maliciously was never beneficial to the miner, then perhaps the first case could be used in situations where ""random"" bytes would suffice, but where a benevolent choice of bytes would be even better for both the author of the contract and the miner, and so, miner software could use random values for it (or just previous block hash), but such that if the miner software could easily enough analyze which values would be even better than random, use that?  

In that case, the hint for which type of non-determinism is requested, could serve as a hint to mining software of either ""just giving me a random value is sufficient here (though I'd appreciate a carefully chosen value~)"" or ""unless you give me a carefully chosen value that actually works for me, including this transaction won't give you nearly as much miner reward, so unless you are going to do that, it is in your best interest to not include this transaction"".

____________________


**An almost entirely separate thought:**

Hm, so, I know there are instructions for ""actually, revert all the changes that this transaction made (including any calls to other contracts it may have made), except for gas fees"".  

But, if there was an instruction that meant ""if this instruction is executed as part of a transaction, then that transaction cannot be included in a valid block"", well... I suppose that miners likely would choose not to even *consider* including transactions which involve a contract that have such a instruction.  
But if there were such an instruction, and some mining software could easily check whether certain transactions would with high confidence not hit that instruction, perhaps it could still be worth checking in those cases? But perhaps it could allow an attack where miners are spammed with potential transactions that they would have to take the time to check if the transactions involve a contract with such an instruction anywhere in it in order to reject it, and this would be too costly even to do that extra check, even without trying to check if the transaction would actually hit the instruction.  

Oh, another issue is if like, one contract does a computation to determine what other contract to call, and the other contract potentially calls a contract which includes this instruction. That would be rather exploitable. That's no good. I suppose this could be handled by saying that if a contract calls another contract which includes this instruction, then the transaction immediately ends but with all the gas costs so far still being paid. (or, alternatively, the miner can choose whether to do that, or to continue. But I'd imagine most would do that and not continue, unless there was a big reward.) That way, miners would only have to check if the first contract to be called contains the instruction in order to decide whether they want to consider attempting the transaction.

The small connection between these two ideas is that like, if you had both, then in the second type of non-determinism, that way you could have a contract that basically says ""query an oracle(the miner) for bytes that satisfy these criteria. If the results do not match the criteria, then they never happened, and not even gas fees are paid."" . And, that seems like it could be useful.  

Of course, one could always set things up so that in one transaction, you set the criteria and provide payment for a reward, and then another transaction (likely by someone else) can provide the required information, and then receives the provided reward, and the computation continues. But this way of doing it would span multiple blocks, so, e.g. this couldn't be done inside a flash loan, or other things that need to be done within a single transaction.

...

Sorry this was kind of stream of consciousness and disjointed.","Could there by a use for ""nondeterministic"" operations determined by block producer? Suppose for the context some blockchain or something in many ways like a blockchain which has a smart contract instruction set (at least analogous to EVM instruction set, or Bitcoin opcodes I suppose).  

Now, aiui, there are already things even in Bitcoin such that what exactly a transaction does depends on the settings of the miner who mines the block. (I haven't checked whether on Bitcoin one can use this to do things other than just ""send some amount of coins to whatever address the block producer lists as their address"" but, this does at least have some dependency on what the block producer chose.).  

But, my question is whether it could potentially be useful to have instructions which expand this influence substantially (when requested by the code being executed as part of the transaction).  

That is, (now, again thinking more on the ""EVM instructions used in a smart contract"" side of the scale than the ""Bitcoin opcodes"" side of the scale), suppose there was an instruction which would request some number of bytes from the mining software, perhaps with a hint for what kind of source these bytes should be from, which the mining software would insert. These bytes provided by the miner would be included in the block so that others validating the blocks could check that the transaction was executed in a valid way, but there would be no technical restriction on what bytes the miner can provide.  

For example, the smart contract could request untrusted-random bytes from the miner. These would not be trustworthy, because if the miner benefited from manipulating them, well, they can choose them to be whatever they want. But, if the benefit of the randomness is just for efficiency of execution, and having no bearing as to the part of the result which is the point of the smart contract, then if the smart contract+transaction was set up such that the miner was no worse off by providing random bytes than if they manipulated the bytes provided to make the contract run inefficiently, then perhaps miners could be expected to set their mining software to provide random bytes in these cases?

Or, instead, suppose the miner is likely to have access to some information which the smart contract can cheaply verify, but which cannot be cheaply computed by the smart contract, and which requires information that the person sending the transaction does not have at the time that they send the transaction (but which the miner of a block including the transaction would be likely to know. Or, alternatively, which their mining software would be likely to know.)  
Then, the smart contract could request the bytes, check if the bytes provided satisfy the condition, and if so, reward the miner, and if not, abort and quit early (to avoid additional gas fees).

(which type of request is being made could be determined by an additional hint parameter, even though from the perspective of validating a block these two things would be equivalent)


(I was originally thinking of such an operation in the context of many interlinked permission-ed chains, each with a single block producer, but where there are links between the different chains where each chain has associated with it a smart contract on a number of the other chains which holds some collateral which, if presented with proof that the one chain has acted invalidly, gives a payout to make whole the person presenting the proof, but, I thought the concept might also be applicable more broadly, and actually, probably more applicable more generally than in the case I was originally thinking of.  
Note that I'm not claiming that the security of the original thing I was thinking of works out. I'm quite unsure of that. This post isn't meant to advocate for that idea.)

**So, my question:** Do you have any arguments for why this would ""(almost) never be a good instruction to support"" ? Do you see any good use-cases that stand out to you?    

I suppose that if one wants some random bytes and is not concerned whether they can be manipulated by an adversary, then just using the hash of the previous block could suffice for that.  
But, also, if a smart contract set things up such that choosing the ""random"" bytes maliciously was never beneficial to the miner, then perhaps the first case could be used in situations where ""random"" bytes would suffice, but where a benevolent choice of bytes would be even better for both the author of the contract and the miner, and so, miner software could use random values for it (or just previous block hash), but such that if the miner software could easily enough analyze which values would be even better than random, use that?  

In that case, the hint for which type of non-determinism is requested, could serve as a hint to mining software of either ""just giving me a random value is sufficient here (though I'd appreciate a carefully chosen value~)"" or ""unless you give me a carefully chosen value that actually works for me, including this transaction won't give you nearly as much miner reward, so unless you are going to do that, it is in your best interest to not include this transaction"".

____________________


**An almost entirely separate thought:**

Hm, so, I know there are instructions for ""actually, revert all the changes that this transaction made (including any calls to other contracts it may have made), except for gas fees"".  

But, if there was an instruction that meant ""if this instruction is executed as part of a transaction, then that transaction cannot be included in a valid block"", well... I suppose that miners likely would choose not to even *consider* including transactions which involve a contract that have such a instruction.  
But if there were such an instruction, and some mining software could easily check whether certain transactions would with high confidence not hit that instruction, perhaps it could still be worth checking in those cases? But perhaps it could allow an attack where miners are spammed with potential transactions that they would have to take the time to check if the transactions involve a contract with such an instruction anywhere in it in order to reject it, and this would be too costly even to do that extra check, even without trying to check if the transaction would actually hit the instruction.  

Oh, another issue is if like, one contract does a computation to determine what other contract to call, and the other contract potentially calls a contract which includes this instruction. That would be rather exploitable. That's no good. I suppose this could be handled by saying that if a contract calls another contract which includes this instruction, then the transaction immediately ends but with all the gas costs so far still being paid.

278,CryptoTechnology,What is web3?,"# What is Web3?

## Ethereum

The Web3 is currently loosely defined. The top search result for any given search engine is usually [Ethereum's Web2 vs Web3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) which comes from the the dev docs. The article clearly defines Web3 as 

&gt; ""Web3, in the context of Ethereum, refers to decentralized apps that run on the blockchain. These are apps that allow anyone to participate without monetising their personal data.""

They clearly state that this definition is within the context of Ethereum. We have a definition and that definition is exclusive to Ethereum. We still don't know what Web3 is even if we read the Ethereum Developer Documentation.

## Wikipedia

Wikipedia also follows the same definition.

&gt; ""Web3, also known as Web 3.0,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3#cite_note-crunch-1) is an idea for a version of the Internet that is decentralized and based on public blockchains.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3#cite_note-:0-2) The concept gained popularity in 2020 and 2021 with interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investments from high-profile technologists and companies.""

The cited sources are from articles that most likely derived the definition from our initial search result on the Ethereum website. One is from Tech Crunch and the other is from Slate.

If we read up on search results, we'll notice something at the end of the __Background__ section.

&gt; ""Web3 is distinguished from a concept for a semantic web created in 1999 by Tim Berners-Lee, which has sometimes also been called ""Web 3.0"".[6] Some writers referring to the decentralized concept usually known as ""Web3"" have used the terminology ""Web 3.0"", leading to some confusion between the two concepts;[1][7] furthermore, some visions of Web3 also incorporate ideas relating to the semantic web.[8][9]""

Now I can see that Web3 has had previous meaning as well. Now I have questions like, ""What is a semantic web?"", ""What were the other previous definitions of Web3?"", and ""Is Web3 solely refering to blockchain technology and if so what is blockchain technology exactly?"".

## Down the rabbit hole

If we actually read the Wikipedia article for the Web3 definition, we should have noticed the __Concept__ section.

&gt; ""Web3 revolves around the idea of a decentralized Internet. Proponents often contrast this to Web 2.0, where large amounts of the web's data and content are centralized in a fairly small group of companies (often referred to as Big Tech).[2] Specific visions for Web3 differ, but all are heavily based in blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[2] Some visions are based around the concepts of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which seek to enable many people to have equal ownership and governance in an organization.[14] Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another key concept, in which users exchange currency without bank or government involvement.[2] Self-sovereign identity allows users to identify themselves without relying on a centralized authentication system like OAuth.[15]""

Let's focus in on the introductory sentence.

&gt; Web3 revolves around the idea of a decentralized Internet.

Does a dencetralized internet have to solely rely on blockchain technology? According to how it's defined in the next sentence, then the answer is yes.

&gt; Specific visions for Web3 differ, but all are heavily based in blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[2]

Meriam Webster Dictionary has defined a blockchain as

&gt; a digital database containing information (such as records of financial transactions) that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network

This is a fairly accurate description of what a blockchain is. A Web App is more than its parts and is more than the total sum of its parts. The database has influence over large aspects of data storage when I build an app and that's usually it.

So now I've just spent a considerable amount of time learning about Distributed P2P Digital Databases that are mostly focused on financial records and transactions. 

Don't get be wrong. This is amazing technology and is comparable to the Gutenberg Press. What the Gutenberg Press did for the written word is what blockchain technology is doing for the modern monetary system and much more. It's essentially creating, and allowing, digital property rights. I don't see how this isn't amazing at all. 

There's just one problem. I still have no idea what Web3 is and if I think I do know what Web3 is, then now what I believe it to be is just a over glorified linked list of SHA256 hash sums that record financial transactions.

I haven't made any progress at all.

## Leaving the Crypto Sphere

Is Crypto the same as Crypto Currency or is Crypto Currency a biproduct of Crypto? This is not the same as asking did the Chicken come before the Egg or did the Egg come before the Chicken? Obviously the Egg came first. Regarless, Crypto came first. Crypto Currency is the result of persistent dedication to figuring out a bunch of different problems with a creative set of solutions. What's more important is the resulting technology; The Blockchain.

If we read the Slate article, we would have noticed something interesting if we were paying attention.

&gt; Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities don’t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for “trust,” referring to the idea that an intermediary does not need to facilitate virtual transactions between two or more parties. Web3 theoretically protects user privacy better as well, because it’s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection.

We currently do not host Web Apps on Databases as far as I know. We do store Data on Databases, but not Apps. So how do I run a truly Distributed P2P Web Application? If I can create a truly Distributed P2P Web App, then where do I store it and how do I launch it?

## Enter IPFS

So ""What is IPFS?"" and ""Why do I believe the Web3 definition is exclusive?"". We first have to ask, ""What is IPFS?"".

&gt; The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.[4]

This actually sounds very different to what Blockchain Technology is and finally answers my burning question. Where and How do I store my App in a Distributed fashion? IPFS is how.

The Blockchain is a Distrubited P2P Database and IPFS is a Distributed P2P Filesystem. This means that they're useful tools in a particular context which is a Distributed System. Blockchain and IPFS are components of that Distributed System. The components are working examples of what Web3 actually is and will be.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a working example of a Distributed P2P Database and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a working example of a Distributed P2P Filesystem. 

It's not just about cryptocurrency or blockchain tech. Thats just a smaller part of the bigger picture at hand and it's reductive at best. I love Crypto Currency and what it's doing. I want to be a part of it as well. However, it's important to stay sharp from time to time and try to see what the problems, and solutions to those problems, are. Sometimes the best way to do that is take a few steps back and try to see what the bigger picture is.

From an ideological point of view, Web3 is mostly about Accessibility and Availability at a level playing field. Web3 is an ideology of moving from Centralization to Decentralization through the process of Distributed Components. There are crypto projects like [lbry / odyssey](https://odysee.com/) that showcase what's possible with a Distributed Web. [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a Crypto Currency project that aims at the storage issue with a Distributed P2P Web.

What's interesting about Odysee isn't the fact that it's another platform with another crypto currency. I could care less about that. What I care about is how Odysee runs under the hood. I'm here to tell you that Odysee is extremely interesting under the hood. Why? Because it runs on IPFS.

I've looked into the IPFS Developer Documentation and it supports mostly the Shell, Go, and Javascript for now (personally, I'm a python programmer, but I can work with JS). I use a self hosted IPFS node through a browser plugin (it comes with brave by default) and a surprising amount of the web just suddenly opens up. 

So far, it's still early stages, and I can't wait to see what comes out of it; the good, the bad, and the ugly. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so interesting.

You can already build your own Distributed Web App and there aren't a lot of resources on it available just yet, but there are plenty of existing projects that showcase what is possible with it. I'd say the biggest issue it has right now is speed and I suspect that it would improve with scale; though I'm no expert on Distributed Systems. 

I'm just a Web App Geek and this was my 2 cents.","What is web3? # What is Web3?

If we actually read the Wikipedia article for the Web3 definition, we should have noticed the __Concept__ section.

&gt; ""Web3 revolves around the idea of a decentralized Internet. Proponents often contrast this to Web 2.0, where large amounts of the web's data and content are centralized in a fairly small group of companies (often referred to as Big Tech).[2] Specific visions for Web3 differ, but all are heavily based in blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[2] Some visions are based around the concepts of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which seek to enable many people to have equal ownership and governance in an organization.[14] Decentralized finance (DeFi) is another key concept, in which users exchange currency without bank or government involvement.[2] Self-sovereign identity allows users to identify themselves without relying on a centralized authentication system like OAuth.[15]""

Let's focus in on the introductory sentence.

&gt; Web3 revolves around the idea of a decentralized Internet.

Does a dencetralized internet have to solely rely on blockchain technology? According to how it's defined in the next sentence, then the answer is yes.

&gt; Specific visions for Web3 differ, but all are heavily based in blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).[2]

Meriam Webster Dictionary has defined a blockchain as

&gt; a digital database containing information (such as records of financial transactions) that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network

This is a fairly accurate description of what a blockchain is. A Web App is more than its parts and is more than the total sum of its parts. The database has influence over large aspects of data storage when I build an app and that's usually it.

So now I've just spent a considerable amount of time learning about Distributed P2P Digital Databases that are mostly focused on financial records and transactions. 

Don't get be wrong. This is amazing technology and is comparable to the Gutenberg Press. What the Gutenberg Press did for the written word is what blockchain technology is doing for the modern monetary system and much more. It's essentially creating, and allowing, digital property rights. I don't see how this isn't amazing at all. 

There's just one problem. I still have no idea what Web3 is and if I think I do know what Web3 is, then now what I believe it to be is just a over glorified linked list of SHA256 hash sums that record financial transactions.

I haven't made any progress at all.

## Leaving the Crypto Sphere

Is Crypto the same as Crypto Currency or is Crypto Currency a biproduct of Crypto? This is not the same as asking did the Chicken come before the Egg or did the Egg come before the Chicken? Obviously the Egg came first. Regarless, Crypto came first. Crypto Currency is the result of persistent dedication to figuring out a bunch of different problems with a creative set of solutions. What's more important is the resulting technology; The Blockchain.

If we read the Slate article, we would have noticed something interesting if we were paying attention.

&gt; Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities don’t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for “trust,” referring to the idea that an intermediary does not need to facilitate virtual transactions between two or more parties. Web3 theoretically protects user privacy better as well, because it’s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection.

We currently do not host Web Apps on Databases as far as I know. We do store Data on Databases, but not Apps. So how do I run a truly Distributed P2P Web Application? If I can create a truly Distributed P2P Web App, then where do I store it and how do I launch it?

## Enter IPFS

So ""What is IPFS?"" and ""Why do I believe the Web3 definition is exclusive?"". We first have to ask, ""What is IPFS?"".

&gt; The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices.[4]

This actually sounds very different to what Blockchain Technology is and finally answers my burning question. Where and How do I store my App in a Distributed fashion? IPFS is how.

The Blockchain is a Distrubited P2P Database and IPFS is a Distributed P2P Filesystem. This means that they're useful tools in a particular context which is a Distributed System. Blockchain and IPFS are components of that Distributed System. The components are working examples of what Web3 actually is and will be.

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) is a working example of a Distributed P2P Database and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a working example of a Distributed P2P Filesystem. 

It's not just about cryptocurrency or blockchain tech. Thats just a smaller part of the bigger picture at hand and it's reductive at best. I love Crypto Currency and what it's doing. I want to be a part of it as well. However, it's important to stay sharp from time to time and try to see what the problems, and solutions to those problems, are. Sometimes the best way to do that is take a few steps back and try to see what the bigger picture is.

From an ideological point of view, Web3 is mostly about Accessibility and Availability at a level playing field. Web3 is an ideology of moving from Centralization to Decentralization through the process of Distributed Components. There are crypto projects like [lbry / odyssey](https://odysee.com/) that showcase what's possible with a Distributed Web. [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is a Crypto Currency project that aims at the storage issue with a Distributed P2P Web.

What's interesting about Odysee isn't the fact that it's another platform with another crypto currency. I could care less about that. What I care about is how Odysee runs under the hood. I'm here to tell you that Odysee is extremely interesting under the hood. Why? Because it runs on IPFS.

I've looked into the IPFS Developer Documentation and it supports mostly the Shell, Go, and Javascript for now (personally, I'm a python programmer, but I can work with JS). I use a self hosted IPFS node through a browser plugin (it comes with brave by default) and a surprising amount of the web just suddenly opens up. 

So far, it's still early stages, and I can't wait to see what comes out of it; the good, the bad, and the ugly. Otherwise, it wouldn't be so interesting.

You can already build your own Distributed Web App and there aren't a lot of resources on it available just yet, but there are plenty of existing projects that showcase what is possible with it. I'd say the biggest issue it has right now is speed and I suspect that it would improve with scale; though I'm no expert on Distributed Systems. 

I'm just a Web App Geek and this was my 2 cents."
279,CryptoTechnology,Interoperability approaches,"Hi all, I'm wondering what projects are there that tackle interoperability and what their approaches are.

I know of:

1. Polkadot/Kusama, the hub and parachains approach. But how (if) interoperability with external chains will be achieved?

2. Cosmos, which is afaik a SDK that standardises the blochchains built with it

3.  Nervos Network - a platform-agnostic L1 that other chains can 'rent out' for their data which is then easily accessible from any chain

Also, how does bridging come into all of this, with projects like wormhole?

284,CryptoTechnology,"Existing Proposed Solutions to the ""Infinitely Growing Ledger Problem""","I don't know what the term for this is, so I am struggling to research what proposed solutions, if any exist for it.

Here's the base problem:

* We keep adding blocks to the blockchain
* The blockchain grows in size each day
* Eventually the blockchain gets so large that only people investing a significant amount of money (more than a high-end consumer computer) can have a full copy of it, mine, or fully verify transactions, trending towards more centralization
* It seems many major coins have infighting about how much to increase block size out of concern for future growth of the size of the total blockchain.

Counter-points to this being a problem that I've heard:

* Storage price per GB will continue to drop in the future, it's something that will keep pace with growth of blockchains, so we don't need to worry that it will become centralized.
* This is inherent to the nature of blockchains and there's nothing that can be done about it, the pros outweigh the cons

I get that the blockchain being immutable and storing history forever is useful, and for something like Bitcoin this seems important, but there are certainly blockchain-based solutions where this is a needlessly resource-intensive feature.

Take a coin like BAT, for example. Yes the blockchain can help create a decentralized advertising infrastructure and yes we need to be able to verify transactions with some degree of security, but do we *really need to know* who paid for a batch of banner ads in 2001? Of fucking course not. At best, we might want a lookback period of a few years and a running tally of the current balances. And there are many other applications of blockchain where this is holds true.

So one obvious solution presents itself to ""prune"" the blockchain every so often. Say every year on Jan 1 we say ""Ok all transactions &gt; 10yrs old now no longer exist, and we've created a larger than usual block for this particular block which lists the ""starting balance"" of all the addresses that had coins in them at the time. Carry on with adding blocks now"". This would obviously break the chain of signatures on transactions up until that point, and I don't have a strong enough handle on the crypto involved to say exactly how the key-signing would work here, but it seems like a thing that could be doable.

The state of Bitcoin mining energy consumption is 197 TWh/year. A US home consumes 10,700 kWh/year or 10,700,000 Wh/year, meaning the energy consumption of 18.4 MILLION US homes.

The level of adoption of the bicoin network is currently ONLY 79 million. What will happen when adoption reaches a billion users? 2 billion users? Let's say the energy consumption scales linearly with the amount of users and miners on the network. That's roughly a 25x increase in consumption for 2 billion users, but I have a feeling this will not scale linearly, since the amount of activity on the network will be exponential rather than linear. 

A conservative 25x increase in consumption will equal 4,925 TWh/year, or 4,925,000 GWh/ year, the equivalent current yearly energy consumption of the US and Russia COMBINED. This is not FUD, it's basic math, and adding more solar panels or wind turbines to power it all will not be able to meet the energy demands of running the network.

Solar and wind are too intermittent to act as baseload to power a system that needs to run at full capacity 24x7, even with the introduction of batteries to extend the energy production and reduce volatility. They can certainly supplement the consumption, but cannot be reliable sources of energy baseload.

Hydro is certainly a consistent source of energy baseload to power the network, but the amount of locations and energy potential is surely too limited to support the amount of energy needed to run the network. Geothermal can be used, but now we're talking about billion dollar capital projects to build those plants, including heavy civil, structural, and electrical work to build, including full time staff and maintenance workers to man the plants and maintain their upkeep.  Multiply that by a few hundred of those plants and maybe you can run the network with the demand discussed above. if we wanted to start considering the energy consumption implications of 3-4 billion users my head starts to spin..

The following article talks about how the Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol called Sovryn can help unbank banking and make the underbanked financially sovereign. Then, it explores the natural evolution of DeFi as we know it. Advancing from Ethereum and other pockets of DeFi to a more robust Bitcoin-based solution could allow millions to participate in the most egalitarian redistribution of wealth in history. **Bitcoin and DeFi can solve the problem of unbanked people and also provide an alternative to current banking systems, which are not accessible to some.**

It also mentions that statistics in countries like Mexico, the Philippines, or Vietnam show that people want an alternative to traditional banking accounts. **Could Bitcoin DeFi be the right choice for these people?** It also delivers a fact that with the upcoming years of the Metaverse phenomenon, Bitcoin is perfectly positioned to be the sound money of the upcoming digital era.

Read the article [here](https://hackernoon.com/defi-on-bitcoin-how-sovryn-is-answering-the-final-criticism-against-bitcoin).

* Part 1 - Prologue and Introduction
* Part 2 - DeFi CeFi comparison
* Part 3 - Benefits of a Bitcoin-based DeFi system
* Part 4 - Meet Sovryn, the most feature-rich platform for Bitcoin DeFi
* Part 5 - Prerequisites for the Bitcoin DeFi and outro

*“States and people that embrace this Bitcoin globalization will benefit from the prosperity and freedom it creates. Those who try to halt progress will fall behind.”*

294,CryptoTechnology,Excellent 3rd party in depth research paper about Syscoin and its new NEVM about to be released.,"House of Chimera have completed their second in-depth study of Syscoin’s blockchain and their upcoming Ethereum smart contract layer that is secured by bitcoins PoW. 

There is already a wealth of technology with Syscoin already on their UTXO layer 1 also secured by bitcoins mergemining with a pioneering zdag tech that allows it to scale to 140k TPS. 

They developed the first ever bridge from BTC to ETH and through this research they have developed a smart contract layer that is unique in its interaction with the other l1. Both layers bridge to one another from the Bitcoin based layer (still 90% core compliant with btc)SYS to the smartcontract layer, SYSX yet both layers will be able to keep track of one another for a considerable time. 

Jag sidhu realised some time ago though that the answer to the trilemma was impossible through l1 and has remained consistent with the Nakamoto consensus at all times for security and decentralisation. This is why they are rapidly pursuing the new advancements in ZKROLLUPS and I believe they will be the first blockchain to use them after Ethereum. 

They already have the first DAO, GoldStandard DAO and the first AMM Dex, MUTE.io to be built on this Zkrollups that they hope to plug in by q1 next year. 

This is just a brief dive into Syscoins far reaching technology but I’m sure you’re all soon going to hear more about it.

301,CryptoTechnology,What justifies using proof-of-work if proof-of-stake achieves the same result?,"If we assume proof-of-stake is a better consensus mechanism/algorithm\*\*\* than proof-of-work, then how will people justify using proof-of-work chains in the future? 

I have recently noticed that some people hate crypto, like really hates crypto. The common critique is the energy consumption from PoW chains, and these people generally don't even bother to research about the subject more after coming to the conclusion ""cryptocurrency bad because it uses too much energy"". So I've been thinking about what a great PR move it will be for ethereum when they move to PoS, and I have a hard time seeing how bitcoiners will be able to justify using proof-of-work to normal people. 

The consensus mechanism debate is a tough one, and sure there are decent arguments for why proof-of-work can be better than proof-of-stake, but it is reeaaaally far-fetched to think that normal people are going to be able to understand these arguments. They will just point to another blockchain with PoS and say ""if they can arrive to consensus with PoS, why can't you?"" In this group of ""normal people"" you will also find 90% of politicians.

Basically, the energy consumption argument is so easy for people to make and it will be sooo easy for politicians to just bash on proof-of-work chains, even if you think they are superior to proof-of-stake ones. What's your thoughts? What would be your arguments for using a proof-of-work chain and how would you explain it to someone who is not into crypto?

305,Dogtraining,"Reminder on downvoting, wiki updates, and community feedback on new type of video post requested.","Hi everyone,

Three topics for today’s announcement, so let’s get right into it.

---

## Downvoting etiquette

Reddit’s official guidelines state that upvoting/downvoting should be used as a measure of *how much a comment contributes to the discussion* and not as a like/dislike button. Of course, we all know that our opinions of whether we dislike something and whether we think it’s a useful contribution often line up with each other. However, there has been an ongoing issue that we’d like to bring to your attention with this example (slightly exaggerated) scenario:

* OP posts asking for help  
* OP says, either in the original post or in a later comment, something along the lines of “yeah, so I got a 5 week old puppy from a Craigslist ad I met in a parking lot, and I started using a prong collar on him the next day…”  
* You are horrified, and reflexively… downvote?  

It can be really hard, but we want to encourage you to either upvote to keep OP in neutral score, or to not vote at all, in these cases. Please remember that OP came here for help, and it’s important to show kindness and consideration for the reason they came to their current position based on their life experience and the knowledge they have had access to prior to this point. Downvoting the OP and their followup comments to below 1 makes it more likely that their request will be missed, and that people will be commenting without the complete set of information OP has provided; and that means it’s less likely that the OP will be supported in their quest for improvement. 

---

So, to recap:  

* Comment providing *advice* to an OP or another commenter which breaches the subreddit rules -&gt; report, and you can also downvote if you like   
* Comment which is not rule-breaking advice, but still poor quality (e.g. recommending extinction procedures exclusively for a self-reinforcing behaviour instead of differential reinforcement of alternative behaviour) -&gt; downvote if you like  
* Thread or followup comment by OP, which includes rule-breaking content as an *explanation* of what they’re doing and not advice to others -&gt; don’t downvote even if you really really want to. No need to report either, as we do want people to see the information to adjust their advice if needed.  
* Don't downvote questions generally. If someone seems to be genuinely asking, assume they're asking because they don't know and either respond, or leave it. Downvoting actual questions will not help the person asking learn to do better.  

---

Similarly, a reminder around being overly judgemental. r/dogtraining includes users from around the globe, and hence there can be cultural clashes between users in terms of dog *keeping* and *care*. Here are some common examples of extreme ranges in what is considered “normal”:  

* The use of crates for confinement management of dogs ranges from widespread endorsement to being explicitly illegal in some circumstances  
* Dogs are variably kept from always outdoors to partially out/partially in to always indoors  
* Dogs can regularly have applied to them nothing at all, minimal objects like flat collars and bandanas, moderate raincoats or boots, all the way up to entire sets of doggy clothes and costumes  

It can be frustrating to talk to someone from a different background whose ideas about how dogs should live are so misaligned with yours that you consider their views ridiculous or abusive. However, if your goal is to change the other person’s mind, you won’t get there through insulting them, labelling them as cruel, downvoting them and so on. Aim to ground your comments in a fundamental review of the actual circumstances, and discuss them in a reasoned way. What are the dog’s genuine needs? What evidence is there as to whether these needs are being met, or not? Is it as much of an issue as it appears at first glance? What is the other person’s reasoning behind their current setup? If it’s advised, what options are there for adjustment, of which there could be multiple *other* than your own personal expectations/experience? Remember the human on the other side of the screen, and the kind of community we build here with each interaction. Merely lashing out at the other person might temporarily make you feel better, but isn’t valuable discussion and mods will exercise discretion in removing such comments as a result.

## Wiki Updates

We’ve been working in the background on expanding the wiki, and if you haven’t seen it yet we have a new page on [veterinary care/husbandry training](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/husbandry). Please check out the tutorials, as this is an area of training that is often missed for many dogs and even a little bit of work can make your life in taking care of your pet a million times easier. We’ve also significantly expanded our recommended book list, and have been adding links to previous relevant threads in the subreddit as examples across multiple topics. 

Of course, some wiki articles were first drafted many years ago, and as we all know the internet often doesn’t stay static. So we’re doing a little crowdsourcing request here: 

~~If you have time, pick a random article in the wiki not already mentioned below, and click every link inside it. Let us know in a comment if all the links work correctly, or if not, tell us which links are broken. Bonus points if you can find a new URL for the same resource, or dredge it up using web-archive, so we can slot it right in to fix!~~

ALL COMPLETE! Thank you so much to kyripka for helping out!

## Video Reviews/Behaviour Analysis

We’ve had a lot of videos posted recently asking “are my dogs playing or not?” or “what is my dog doing?” We’ve worked to cut down on the number of generic non-problematic play videos coming up on the front page, but we also want to start [a more in-depth video analysis program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/pdcpyf/trainers_behaviorists_replacement_for_donna_hills/) on a recurring basis. This will be a good opportunity to practice your dog behaviour observation skills - we will be encouraging people to really tease apart individual components and include timestamps, rather than just a simple overall assessment. So [here’s a poll](https://forms.gle/7vshDAAJGoaQnwir5) for you so that we can find your preferences on the format and frequency of these reviews!  

  
Thanks and happy dog training,  

The Dogtraining Mod Team","Reminder on downvoting, wiki updates, and community feedback on new type of video post requested. Hi everyone,

Three topics for today’s announcement, so let’s get right into it.

## Downvoting etiquette

Reddit’s official guidelines state that upvoting/downvoting should be used as a measure of *how much a comment contributes to the discussion* and not as a like/dislike button. Of course, we all know that our opinions of whether we dislike something and whether we think it’s a useful contribution often line up with each other. However, there has been an ongoing issue that we’d like to bring to your attention with this example (slightly exaggerated) scenario:

* OP posts asking for help  
* OP says, either in the original post or in a later comment, something along the lines of “yeah, so I got a 5 week old puppy from a Craigslist ad I met in a parking lot, and I started using a prong collar on him the next day…”  
* You are horrified, and reflexively… downvote?  

It can be really hard, but we want to encourage you to either upvote to keep OP in neutral score, or to not vote at all, in these cases. Please remember that OP came here for help, and it’s important to show kindness and consideration for the reason they came to their current position based on their life experience and the knowledge they have had access to prior to this point. Downvoting the OP and their followup comments to below 1 makes it more likely that their request will be missed, and that people will be commenting without the complete set of information OP has provided; and that means it’s less likely that the OP will be supported in their quest for improvement.

Anything I can do to improve? "
308,Dogtraining,Emergency Dogsitting Situation,"I’ve been pet sitting with my partner at our home for over a year now and have done a bunch of dogs before with no big issues. 

We meet and greet dogs and owners before we say yes too. 

We now have a Black German Shepherd since yesterday and she is very lovely. Good temperament, smart, obedient, desexed female, 10 months old.

Today, a 4 year old submissive Husky x Samoyed desexed female came along and also has good temperament. Very sweet and obedient.

Both usually very good with other dogs and at dog parks, according to owners.

But the German Sherpherd has not been friendly at all, and has been very aggressive towards the other dog. A lot of growling and scary snarling. The other dog has been hiding behind us. 

For hours, I let them:
- meet on leash (lots of powerful dragging and snarling from the German Sherpherd whilst the other dog sat and was still/ relaxed)
- (At this point I’ve exchanged messages including videos with the German Sherpherd owners that I am embarrassed and sorry that we may have to get an emergency contact to drop the German Sherpherd off to their friends, because we wanted to manage their expectations but the owners were very defensive and told me to get the other dog owner to find a new sitter lol)
- tried walking together on opposite sides of road with treats and positive reinforcement (still lots of pulling and snarling and barking from GS)
- meet through metal door with treats and positive reinforcement (very aggressive barking from GS and other dog decided to howl now)
- and finally; after hesitating for hours, decided to let them meet off leash (what the German Shepherd owner highly suggested, as they said the German Sherpherd is usually very good with all sorts of dogs including Samoyeds and Huskys)

At first, they politely sniffed and played nice, but in a snap, the German Sherpherd really seemed like she really wanted to assert dominance and kept pushing the other dog around, barking really really loudly, and tore the other dog’s fur out. It scared us all. Happened a few times before we decided this isn’t going to work.

Do we have any other suggestions on how to re-introduce them? They will be together with each other for another 5 days!

Honestly I felt so afraid myself and have never felt so much adrenaline being near a dog too. 

Thank you so much in advance.

EDIT:

Thanks everyone. I’m glad my partner and I are not “hallucinating” and not reading the dogs’ body language wrongly.

We really didn’t want them to keep meeting but the GS owners insisted and actually made me feel like I didn’t understand dog behaviour, (incl. comments like You really don’t want to let them off leash to meet? I guarantee it my GS is the sweetest baby) which made me feel incompetent. I know I should’ve trusted my gut instincts. 

I got desperate after and want to share this here with you all. Thank you for all your thoughts and comments. 

I will keep them separated so that none of them are injured. I’m sure it is also a first-time experience for the GS to be aggressive like this, which is why the owner is reluctant to believe me. I don’t blame the owners. 

According to the GS owner, the GS makes friends with everyone at the park, in their home, out on walks with all dogs at all times. Same for the other dog. GS has also been at other pet sitters with multiple dogs with no issues at all.

Also to clarify: the first meet when they were both on leash, the Samoyed x Husky never pulled on her leash and was sitting calmly, whereas the GS was always just barking, snarling and aggressive.

It will be a lesson for me to not board big dogs, especially puppies, like this again. I’ve boarded 4 dogs once with a mix of female and big/ small dogs with full behaviour descriptions given to me by owners and they always get along. But I think this will make me rethink thrice. 

I have been updating the Samoyed x Husky owner the entire time too, and thankfully she is super understanding. She said the dogs will probably get along with more time but yeah, I don’t think it’s a need for them to be friends. I’ll rotate and balance their meal times, walks, play and attention with separated space (either a dog inside and the other outside the house/ a dog in a crate indoors with door closed and the other roaming around).

Sidenote - even my partner who absolutely loves GS dogs and had two growing up, is terrified and decided from this incident, not to have a GS in the future from how he saw the GS flip behaviours in a snap.","Emergency Dogsitting Situation I’ve been pet sitting with my partner at our home for over a year now and have done a bunch of dogs before with no big issues.

Update: We put her in a travel carrier she was sleeping in before we got her and she calmed way down and was able to sleep in a few hour intervals. So I guess we’ll use that and then work on transitioning her from it to the crate. 

Do I take her out every time she cries? And then just put her back in every time she’s ok? And then repeat? Then how do I get any sleep?

Should I let her sleep in our bed until she gets more accustomed to the crate over time?

311,Dogtraining,Is it okay to let my dog accidentally bite me during play?,"Its usually during tug. She would try to get it back from me, or try to get a better grip, and she would accidentally bite me instead of her toy. Its never enough to draw blood, and its usually not enough that it even hurts. As long as it stays like that, it isn't a problem.

My question is WILL it stay like that? Is continuing to play after she accidentally bites me going to somehow encourage harder bites during play, or god forbid biting outside of play? Or is this just a normal dog thing? She does have an understanding that it hurts and once she realizes she's biting me not her toy she always lets go which is why I always just continue playing.","Is it okay to let my dog accidentally bite me during play?

312,Dogtraining,Outdated puppy school!,"Last week I got my 2 teens to take our puppy to puppy school, as I have gone through many levels. Of dog training and actually was asked to teach the class at one point. We went with a random organisation because no one I had used before or heard of had any spaces.

So I paid upfront and my teens came home on tears! The silly bint had taught them dominance theory, that you should always walk through ugh a door first, never get on the same level as your dog, always make him eat after the humans etc. As our puppy will be bred (maximum of 3 times a year apart) she said she would never be an assistance dog because having puppies changed a dog's personality and she would not be the same dog. That sort of thing.

Obviously we are not going back, and I am going to try to get a refund. But does anyone have some good, intimidating resources I can use to proves that she is full of (dog) sh!t?

314,Dogtraining,Normal play between gsd puppy and kitten?,"We are crazy people and got an 10 week old gsd and 6 week old Siamese kitten at the same time (we did not know he was so young when we got him, I’m aware this is not recommended). Anyway, it’s been nearly 2 months and also some of the hardest months of my life. Obviously most of my time and energy is spent training, walking, and playing with our GSD (on top of my full time job, ofcourse). She’s been through extensive training and for being 4.5 months she is doing well. Knows commands, is crate and potty trained, and is on a pretty good schedule finally. We have a great dog park nearby with very responsible owners and well behaved dogs and she plays well there a couple times a week. She also does day care and receives nothing but great reviews with dogs of all sizes. 

Anyway, the real question I have is about safe play between the two animals. From day 1 they have interacted and been very curious about eachother. At first it was very limited interaction, but the cat always pushed the limit and wanted to be near the dog. Now that the kitty is a little bigger (a whopping 4.5ish pounds vs the 45lbs puppy) they are allowed to play more freely. Typically the cat will post up under the couch and they’ll fight/mouth eachother from there, assuming the cat feels safer this way. Being a GSD she does have strong prey drive will chase the cat any chance she can, but when she gets to him shes not doing anything aggressive it seems. A lot of mouthing at his head, his body, his ears… the cat will just lay there most of the time or go on his belly. There are times the kitten will squeal and I will immediately call her off and she will come to me. Even after this the cat does not run away! Sometimes the kitty will pounce on her head and bite on her muzzle, hanging off her like he’s clinging a mountain! Anyway, it’s exhausting constantly policing them but ofcourse I do. Lately my kitten will sneak downstairs when I’m working upstairs to play with the puppy…. I often find them “duking it out” on the couch and when I come down, they turn around startled like HS kids making out! There’s never been any accidents or broken skin to this point. 

My husband thinks they are fine and if the cat felt threatened he wouldn’t constantly seek her out. He even tries to nap in her crate sometimes! I just know that any kitten/puppy play videos I’ve seen online or on Instagram look nothing like how my pets play. Afterwards my kitten is completely soaked in puppy saliva. I’m also worried I’ll have to watch them like this for the rest of my life. 

Anyone have a similar situation?","Normal play between gsd puppy and kitten?

Sometimes the kitty will pounce on her head and bite on her muzzle, hanging off her like he’s clinging a mountain! Anyway, it’s exhausting constantly policing them but ofcourse I do. Lately my kitten will sneak downstairs when I’m working upstairs to play with the puppy…. I often find them “duking it out” on the couch and when I come down, they turn around startled like HS kids making out! There’s never been any accidents or broken skin to this point. 

My husband thinks they are fine and if the cat felt threatened he wouldn’t constantly seek her out. He even tries to nap in her crate sometimes! I just know that any kitten/puppy play videos I’ve seen online or on Instagram look nothing like how my pets play. Afterwards my kitten is completely soaked in puppy saliva. I’m also worried I’ll have to watch them like this for the rest of my life. 

Anyone have a similar situation?"
315,Dogtraining,For the past year our daaschund barks at the tv non stop.,"Tried everything. The worst is when it’s a dog, he will go nuts for 5 min and we have to remove him from the tv and not let him see it. Other ones, a noise or other visual stimuli will set off his defense mechanism and he will bark like crazy. Tried redirection, treats, spray, noise, toys, nothing seems to work long term. Not sure we want to spray him with water. Just want to relax at end of night. Even if he gets a long hour walk he still barky barks.

The only thing that will chill him out is 2 hours at a dog park but cannot do that everyday. Sweater on him also works to an extent.
Any advice ? He is two and a half and male. Yorkie daaschund mix. Dorkie","For the past year our daaschund barks at the tv non stop. Tried everything.

317,Dogtraining,Tips on how to pen a dog in a room?,"So we just sold our crate because our six-month-old husky/shepherd/idkprobablyeverythingelse mix was not having it. 

We have a small house and keep a gate at the top of the stairs to keep her downstairs during the day if we're not up there. 

We've had her three weeks and over the last week we've made a conscious effort to make her have more alone time. The best thing was we started feeding her meals in a kong, which has given her as many as 40-45 consecutive minutes alone where she isn't following us or doing mischief.

Long way to get to the question: what tips do you have for penning a dog in a room? We need to be able to get out of the house. I work from home most days but errands gotta get done and all that jazz. 

She's very comfortable in our dining room. Hardwood floors and it has the door to the backyard so she's in there regularly. Our idea is to do one of two things:

1. Get a pen and put it in the room. We can downsize our table and give her more space.

2. Simply move our gate down to the dining room. That's easier but she is a chewer and we wouldn't want her chewing on the furniture legs.

She's come a long way in three weeks and this feels like the last major hurdle for us to work on in training. Please help if you can.","Tips on how to pen a dog in a room? So we just sold our crate because our six-month-old husky/shepherd/idkprobablyeverythingelse mix was not having it.

323,Dogtraining,Sudden dog agression,"My dog has always been okay with other dogs until recently. He's still totally fine with my parents dogs, but if a dog in the store walks up to us, he appears just curious at first, then starts to growl suddenly. Doesn't matter the size or gender of the other dog. I thought it was just overly hyper dogs, but today he started growling at a docile and small rottweiler puppy. It's weird too because I'll call him back to me and lightly tug on the leash and he'll come back, and keep watching the other dog from a distance while wagging his tail and showing no more agression. It's only when he gets nose to nose with the other dog. He's always on a leash when I take him out. I try to continue my conversation with the other owner from a distance once he's by my side again so he sees there's no reason to fear the other dog. When this first started, I was on a walk with my friend and her husband and her dog. Her dog is the same size as mine but significantly more muscular. Her dog pulls on the leash and would try to run up to my dog to play. My boy would growl at him, so we decided to walk at a distance. Which was weird but I didn't want the dogs to fight. At the very end when we were saying goodbye, my dog snapped at her dog and it terrified me. Luckily her dog was completely unphased and kept wagging his tail and trying to play. We left quickly after that. He is a neutered male and has been neutered for I think about 7 or 8 months. He is not two yet, he'll be two in April (we think. He was a rescue). 

Before I had him he had quite a few owners with multiple dogs, I was never told of any agression. In fact the opposite, that he was attached to his other dog friends. He's okay with my parents much bigger dogs still like he always has been. He's fine with their very small dog too. He tolerated my grandparents dogs, even though one of them (very small one) growls at him and the other is a puppy who won't leave him alone. He loves my cat. I have been socializing him with other dogs in the store and on walks for a super long time. Like, sense he was about 8 months old probably (when I got him, and he had been living with large numbers of other dogs before that with no problems).

I'm just worried and want some advice on how I can help him. Thanks

I'm wondering if he's becoming possessive of me specifically, but I'm not sure how to proceed.


Edit: He still loves people. A little too much, even sketchy people that make me nervous on walks. He'll walk right up to them with his tail wagging and stand near them waiting for pets.

328,Dogtraining,Dog sitting is getting totally out of hand,"Hello! First post here and it's a long one. I've recently started dog sitting and it seems to be turning into more than I anticipated. So background, I have a 5 1/2 month old Australian Kelpie and I'm dog sitting a 6 year old rescue (unsure of breed). We're staying in a one room cabin, I'll be dog sitting for 3 weeks and I work 2 days a week. The owners basically dropped her off with a big bag of food and said she runs away occasionally but always comes back and to just do the same thing with their dog as I do my for my puppy. Now this sounded weird to me but I'm new to dog life and this is my accommodation for the time so I didn't question it.

The dogs usually get on fine but occasionally my puppy won't quit playing and this annoys the rescue who trys to find safe space. I'm working on the done command with my puppy and were already seeing progress. Not really an issue as my guys still a puppy but definitely adding to the stress of the resuce. 

Another issue is on walks. Now I gather that the resuce was allowed free roam/was not leashed. This doesn't work for me though as it makes my puppy pull aggressively and the resuce almost got hit by 2 vehicles. So just too much stress. We now walk double leash but the rescue is full steam ahead which makes it hard to keep the puppy in control. And again my puppy will keep trying to ""play"" with the rescue but she wants nothing to do with it. Nothing too bad though. 

Finally and this is the big issue is on the first day when I  fed the resuce (she eats this really strong smelling fish food) my puppy got too close and the resuce snapped at him like super aggressively. Now whenever I give my puppy a kong or wet food toy the resuce will follow him around scavenging. Sometimes all is good but randomly my puppy will snap at the resuce. He's never done shit like this he usually is very open with his toys. A couple of times it got real scary and I was nervous to even break them up.

Now this is becoming really stressful for me as I'm about to start work and was planning on leaving them together well I'm there. My Australian Kelpie was challenging enough to get to where we are. Now I feel like we're regressing so much and this resuce is creating all these issues. It's making training even harder and I'm not a experienced dog owner.  I can't even feed the dog my treats as It threw up the first day after I fed her some. It also doesn't even know any tricks and feels like a waste to give it treats for doing nothing.

I just don't even know how to handle this situation. I don't know if I'm committed to correcting the behaviour of this dog that's not mine.

Like he legitimately completely goes out of control and will start barking and whining and whimpering and running around the house. Jumping on sofas, beds, tear down curtains and what not.

I wanna know why exactly he does that and what can I do to stop this behaviour. It's getting completely out of control whenever that other dog is around to the point that I have no other option other than shut every window in the house and lock the doors.

My dog is male and not neutered."
330,Dogtraining,How to teach maximum off leash distance when hiking.,"Let me preface by saying my dog's recall is solid. Comes 95% of the time and if I feel like he won't come the next time around, I leash him. My issue is not recall.

For the past few months, my 15mo MI dog's off leash ""maximum mommy distance"" has gotten bigger and bigger until he is now taking off an upwards of 300ft away from me. Even at that distance, he comes when called to get a treat, but then he's off again. I'm not okay with it - I want 60ft at the most, preferably 30ft. 

He's been back on a 20ft long line for a month now. I've tried taking him off a couple times, but it's like releasing a greyhound from a racing box - he's free!!! It's funny, but annoying. Going back to the long line doesn't seem to be teaching him ""this is as far as I want you to go"". He just seems to see it as a restrictive tether. 

I've tried marking when he gets to the 20/30ft distance, but I don't think he understands I'm marking his distance and not him sniffing/marking/doing other doggy things. I give him treats/indulge in toys when he's near me, but he prefers the environment. I don't blame him; hiking is way more interesting than city walks and he wants to make the best of it. 

Ideas? Videos? I can only find resources on recall.

332,Dogtraining,Pup biting,"Hey guys! So yesterday I got a new 2 month old pup. And obviously he tries to bite everything, but mostly my hands, as if they were his toys.

333,Dogtraining,Is there any healthy dog food?!,"Hired a behaviorist, he said to combat my dogs anxiety one of the things I should do is step up dog food quality. I was using blue Buffalo brown rice and chicken, not terrible I'm told but not great. So after some phone calls I landed on the fact that grain free is best, and a brand called ""fromm"" I switched them too. Well after weeks of acclimating them to this new food I saw a vet specialist for a physical and blood work (again for anxiety, advice from same behaviorlist) talked about his issues and told him about the new food. He said grain free is NOT better and could even be dangerous? I am completely lost at this point does anyone have any narrower advice on this, I'm really really hoping the fromm stuff is OK. 

I noticed since eating the fromm he pants a bit when just chillin, seems to be anxiety BUT his tail is wagging when he's doing it. Seems to just be full of energy from this new food, he plays more too and just seems happier overall. But specifically the vet said this stuff can cause cardiac issues, didn't go into details why. He also said during the physical his heart sounded strong, just wanting to add all the relevant details I can. Thanks!

Edit: forgot to mention, vet said to avoid peas, and lentils. Fromm has both of these.","Is there any healthy dog food?!

339,Dogtraining,Beyond frustrated with loose leash training,"I have two dogs: Stella, a 3.5 year old pittie mix that I’ve had since October 2019; and Alex, a Dutch shepherd mix, around a year old, that we adopted from the rescue I work at in September 2021. Stella and I used to go on multiple walks every day when it was just her. Alex has been horrible on the leash but we just finished a 6 week training class and she’s gotten better. She’s usually alright on the leash by herself. And Stella used to be beautiful on the leash, no pulling unless she really had to use the bathroom. Now it’s the opposite. Stella has been pulling a little bit, even walking by herself. But the issue is when I try to walk them together. They both pull and feed off of each other’s excited energy and it’s such an embarrassing and horrible experience that I just haven’t been walking them, just letting them play on our balcony.

340,Dogtraining,Will doggy daycare help or hurt my puppy's frustrated greeting?,"I have a 7 month old female Frenchie and she always gets super excited around other dogs. If the dog is closer than 10ft away, she'll try to run up to it and say hello. If we are on leash, this will usually escalate to her barking at the dog though I try to remove her from the situation before it gets to that point. I would like to be able to take a break from her every now and then and am wondering about taking her to a doggy daycare where they have all day play. However, I do not know how this will affect her current behavior. Is this normal puppy behavior where she wants to go up to every dog? Will taking her to daycare help her socialize with other dogs? Will it hurt it by further cementing the idea ""that all dogs are fun and I need to run up to every one""? 

Furthermore, when she was a puppy we were instructed to not take her to puppy socials until she was at least 12 weeks. We took her a few times (4-5) between 12-16 weeks until she aged out.

342,Dogtraining,1 year-old Airedale-shepherd,"My dog was a rescue. His background is he had a home which didn’t work out (he got ‘too big’) then spent several months at a very loving rescue centre.

He’s been with me for nearly three weeks. In a typical day, he will get an hour or so very vigorous exercise (fetching a ball like a rocket from 70 yards away or so - over and over, it’s the most amazing stamina and fitness he’s got) plus a couple of 20 minute walks, some training, and maybe a trip in the car for 45 minutes to the store and back with the windows down, which almost seems to count for exercise with him, as he seems so engaged with looking and smelling what’s going on. 

I get it that dogs have a lot of energy and need attention, but he seems to have almost limitless energy and to need attention pretty much all of the time. He’s taken to ‘speaking to me’ with sort of semi barks and cute sort of play growls to mean he wants - I guess - attention or to go out. But he’s started to do this very very frequently. If I ignore him, he barks louder and seems to get offended. My reading seems to suggest that the burden is on the owner. If he wants attention then I must give it. But I just can’t give him attention all of the time. I have stuff I need to do, like work and relax with a book. It’s beginning to worry me and make me feel bad if I give myself this time, and to really piss him off sometimes, making him sulky or sad.

The other issue is with his night time outside-time. Recently he’s been demanding to go out to the yard many many times of an evening. In a cottage at the back of the yard there lives the milk-maid, who has to get up at an ungodly hour to bring the cows in. Ollie likes her very much, also likes her male terrier. He’s started when I let him out for his (alleged) need to do his business to go up to her cottage and start yowling. And not come when I call. If I try to catch him he starts ‘herding’ me with a hint - maybe - of aggression. I have the whistle, which I don’t want to over-use as it seems an ‘almost‘ sure thing with him, and he associates it with top grade treats like a warm sausage or a bit of meat. And I want it for emergencies. So he won’t come. And he’s barking at this poor girl right outside her bedroom where she’s sleeping and has to get up in a couple of hours. It really upsets me.When I eventually get him in, I want to punish him, by confining him to a limited part of the house, away from me.

He doesn't act aggressive when I try to take it, he lets me take it he just puts his ears back and lays his head on top of it and wags his tail. I'm still able to take it without issue.

The only problem we have at the moment is how he reacts around my brother's dog. 

We look after my brother's dog (a 1 year old Lhasa Apso)  a couple of times a week when his girlfriend has to go into the office. The two dogs get on well except the puppy goes absolutely crazy with excitement. He and the Lhasa run laps around the house chasing each other and the puppy jumps all over the Lhasa, trying to snap and tug at his ears and tail. The Lhasa seems to enjoy it and doesn't do anything to correct this, so the chasing can last for a good 30mins to an hour. Lately, we've noticed the puppy has started ripping out some of the Lhasa's fur during this chasing and there has been the occasional snapping from the Lhasa when food and toys have come into the equation, so obviously we need this hyper play to stop. 

We've tried redirection with toys and treats, but the puppy is so fixated on the Lhasa that even when the redirection works, he's back at the Lhasa a few minutes later. The puppy is due his final injection next week, so we can start taking him on walks to tire him out, and we're all off work at the moment so we're going to be stepping up his training, but we're really worried about this excessive play behaviour extending to other (potentially not quite as accepting) dogs. 

We have a holiday in a month where we know there's going to be a temperamental dog - we will of course be keeping them VERY separate but we would like to have our puppy trained so he doesn't immediately go barrelling towards this other dog to play and potentially end up injured if she snaps.

Any advice on how we can stop his fixation on other dogs or the hyper play once it begins?","Puppy goes crazy around other dog We recently got a 11 week old Jack Russel Terrier puppy.

347,Dogtraining,"Reactivity to other dogs, but only in our apartment?","I adopted a dog (6y m) nearly 5 months ago and he's a great guy. He's well mannered and sweet, but he has one problem area that I think has been getting worse. Whenever another unit in our apartment lets her dog out, he is very reactive. He's a big dog, so he has a Big Dog Bark. He'll bark frantically at the front door as they pass by, then at the windows as he watches them run outside. 

How can I train him out of that barking? It's really disruptive and I fear being a bad neighbor for making so much noise. 

For additional context:
- When on the street, he gives no mind to other dogs. He looks away from dogs he can see and doesn't respond to dogs that bark from their fences or houses. 
- The neighbor in question has 3-4 dogs. 2 of them are barking just about all day. He doesn't usually seem to care about that, though.
- When the neighbor takes her dogs out, they are unleashed and run down two flights of stairs and hand out on my apartment's floor, still barking. It gets chaotic and loud. Sounds like a stampede. (We've asked her to leash her dogs when they're walking through the apartment- no avail.) 
- About 2 months ago, one of this neighbor's dogs attacked mine in the shared backyard. The neighbor's dog was unleashed (as mentioned) and jumped him immediately. Thankfully, the neighbor's dog was muzzled because she knows he isn't trained socially.

After that event, his reactivity became worse. He started out by whining at the front door, then progressed to whining with a single bark, to a few barks, and now it's become a lot. 


What should I do about this reactivity? I can't tell if he's anxious or defensive, or if he's trying to greet them. We haven't observed aggression towards other dogs before, so we're stumped about what to do.","Reactivity to other dogs, but only in our apartment?

349,Dogtraining,Introducing New Dog To Older Dogs,"I have a two German Shepherds (7 &amp; 8).  We had a chihuahua/terrier mix that passed away six months ago and we decided to adopt an 8 mo year old French Bulldog.  The introduction didn't go as well as we hoped.  One german shepherd lunged at him and the other tried to nip at him.  I tried placing the new puppy in the crate so they could sniff each other safely....This went well for awhile..... Tails wagging, etc.  But my older german shepherd stands at the crate barking with her tail between her legs..... Not an aggressive bark...  maybe more frustrated because the new guy is behind a barrier...  The other german shepherd seems more friendly with him, but has lunged at the crate a couple of times.... He however will lay down next to the crate.  i'm terrified to introduce them again without a barrier....

350,Dogtraining,Is this dog impossible to teach tricks?,"**EDIT: I don't think it is a lack of motivation. He loves treats, it's just the way he is that he just sits and stares when he wants something, he doesn't jump around or move like most dogs would. So how can I reward him for something if he doesn't move at all. For his paw I did try taking his paw in my hand, even though I know this is not the best way to teach him, but he doesn't seem to be connecting the treat to the paw.**

I've taught many dogs tricks over the years. So when my friend bet me that I wouldn't be able to teach her dog any tricks while I am dog sitting him over Christmas, I was of course very confident!

Her dog is not badly behaved or anything, in fact he is very calm most of the time. The problem is when I have a treat he just sits and stares at my face, nothing else. I have no movement at all to reward for...

I tried to get him to give paw, but he never moves his feet, I've tried everything, but he just won't move his feet by himself at all... I've also tried to get him to turn by following the treat in my hand, but again he just stares at my face and doesn't move! I've tried 3 days in a row, about 5-10 minutes each time.

351,Dogtraining,Barking pup,My three month y/o Rottie Shepard rescue barks at me whenever I eat.  I feed him first.

352,Dogtraining,I don’t own a dog. But I’m dogsitting for the week and have some questions.,"Husky/German shepherd mix. She’s a beautiful dog, and very affectionate. A big licker. Today is day 2/7. I’ve been thinking more seriously about getting a dog lately, and thought this could be a good trial run. I’m also aware that this breed isn’t exactly the lowest maintenance or easiest to handle. 

Anyway, she knows basic commands pretty well: sit, come, wait, leave it, paw, down. At first I thought she was well trained because she follows these commands well. 

The issue I’m having has to do with walks. She has a habit of being unwilling to turn around and head back home, even after I say “come”.  Sometimes, I’ve found a very stern “come” does the trick. But sometimes, it doesn’t. Tonight, for example, before we went out, I could tell she had a lot of energy, and she was also humping me a bit, which I read can be a sign of asserting dominance?

So I took her out for a nice long walk. Longer than we’ve gone before, about a mile and a quarter out, before turning around to come back. She pulled the same thing: took a seat, and refused to move. Now, I know very little about training dogs so I have no idea if this was affective, but I responded to this by pretending to be on a phone call, so that she would think I wasn’t really concerned with her antics. Perhaps that worked, because one stern come later and she finally did come. But I was annoyed at that point and felt like I needed to assert some dominance. 

So for the rest of the walk, I kept her on a much tighter leash, didn’t let her decide the route to go home as she usually likes to do, and for the most part she was obedient. Except a couple times, when she tried to go her own way, and I told her no, she did not earn that tonight. I did still let her stop and smell things, as I know that’s very important for dogs, but not as with as much leeway as I previously did. 

So we get home, and she goes straight for the treat cabinet, as she is accustomed to getting treats after a walk. 

Let me pause for a moment and give a little bit of context about the treats. 

I previously asked the owners how many treats they usually give her. Their response was “as many as possible“. Now this cabinet is chalk full of all sorts of treats: beef jerky, chicken jerky, waffle crisp things, bones, bunch of other stuff. I refused to give her a treat, as I felt she did not deserve one. I told her this (how effective is talking to dogs? Haha) I did give her her dive dive dinner instead: kibble mixed with some mozzarella cheese, as the owners instructed. She ate that, but still scratched at the treat cabinet. I refused to give her treats, and she did not like that. She started barking at me, with increasing aggressiveness. Barking, whining, growling. I continue to tell her sternly that she did not deserve treats, but I did give her a chewy digestive stick thing that she hasn’t gone for previously. She was not interested. I held my ground, she kept barking. Eventually she relented, took that treat, and chewed on it for five or so minutes, before laying down and closing her eyes. 

First of all, am I foolish for trying to go down this road, given that I’m only dog sitting? 

Do I have the right approach with trying to assert my dominance and not reward her with treats when she acts this way? 

Does the owner’s “as many treats as possible” approach seem odd?

I’m very conscious of the fact that I don’t actually know what I’m doing, and I’m open to anybody’s thoughts on the matter!","I don’t own a dog.

353,Dogtraining,Dog's seemingly sudden aggression,"Hey all! I have a 3 yr old (will be 4 in February) pit mix named Honey that I rescued in Savannah, GA when she was 6 months old. I was going to school down there but was originally from the Reading, PA area. She's my best friend. We've moved a few times and traveled a ton together. I was always taking her places with me and working on training. She was always the sweetest dog. Never any aggression issues. She definitely changed people's minds about her breed, including my skeptic parents. But everything has changed over the last few months. 

My father was diagnosed with cancer in March of 2020. From then until June of 2021 when he passed, we were at my parent's home in PA. I was taking care of him. We sold my parents home in July, and I moved closer to Philly. My mom moved down to Myrtle Beach with our family dog, Freeway. The first month at my new apartment everything was fine. In October, I noticed her starting to aggressively bark at strangers. But it was only happening at the complex. I took her down to Myrtle Beach with me in November, no issues. At the beginning of this month, I got a trainer. Everything was going well for the first few weeks. I saw VAST improvement. Then, the last 4 days or so, it's been a rapid decline. It started at the complex with the barking again. We left yesterday morning to come back to Myrtle Beach to see my mom for Christmas. Then, this afternoon she actually went to bite someone else's dog. This behavior is so far out of the scope of the dog I know. And I feel like it's all happening so fast. I've never hurt her. I've always been dedicated to her. 

I called my vet to see about maybe ruling out a medical issue. I'm at such a loss. I feel like I've lost my best friend. I'm exhausted. I've literally spent all my free time trying to fix this issue. Any suggestions or previous experiences would be appreciated. I just want her to be happy and healthy. 

(I would like to mention since I know it will be brought up, the sudden moving and change is not foreign to Honey. We moved every year I lived in Savannah, as well as going back and forth during breaks for school. She has always been extremely adaptable. Not to say it couldn't be that she's overwhelmed. It would just be bizarre to me at this point.)","Dog's seemingly sudden aggression Hey all!

355,Dogtraining,Recommendations for my Cockapoo puppy?,"Hi everyone, I am a first time puppy owner, a cute 9-week-old Cockapoo :)

He has been with me for the past 4 days and I already made some progress in making him feel safe at his new home. 
I would love to hear some reco on what to do when he starts teething my hands / feet hard and on what to try for his potty training to achieve fast results.

For biting, I have been giving him a high pitch “ouch” and taking my hands / feet away followed by offering toys to chew on. I will also try turning my back to him and putting my hands in my armpits as soon as he puts his teeth harder. I also read that some puppy owners “calmly” put them on their crates to signal them that the game is over as soon as they teeth hard…. Really like to hear what worked best for the puppy owners here.

For potty training, i have been able to lure him to the training pad with some treats but i could only make him pee on the pad, not poop :)
Love to hear community’s comments on this as well.","Recommendations for my Cockapoo puppy? Hi everyone, I am a first time puppy owner, a cute 9-week-old Cockapoo :)

We have a second dog who loves everyone with incredibly rare exceptions. His example hasn't seemed to rub off on dog #1. Any advice?"
358,Dogtraining,How can I help my elderly deaf dog to stop being bored and frustrated?,"Cocker spaniel age 12 and completely deaf. She became deaf in the last 2 years. She gets a walk every day but relatively short cause she has bad arthritis. 

Every single night she ends up barking at me and won’t stop until I give her treats. I feel like she’s bored. She doesn’t get to do much in the afternoon. Everyone sits down and watches tv and she can either sleep or stare into space. If I try and play with her with a toy she starts barking and literally won’t stop. It’s really really loud. If I sit on the floor to cuddle her she starts barking. If I give her attention she starts barking. If I follow her she goes into the kitchen and stares at the food drawer. 

The only way I stop it is by giving treats or a carrot. 

Do you think another nighttime walk? 

I just did some retrieving with a toy and she is really into it if food is involved. But it only took up like five minutes and I don’t wanna push her physically yknow? I also did some practicing of tricks she learned growing up and she’s good at that. I just bought a snuffle mat which should be fun for her as an afternoon activity. She seems so much more relaxed in the day when she can just nap.","How can I help my elderly deaf dog to stop being bored and frustrated? Cocker spaniel age 12 and completely deaf.

359,Dogtraining,My two puppies keep playing rough with each other.,"I have two 4 month old puppies that are siblings. They have been together their whole lives and do everything together. They love to play together but every time they do it turns into them running around the room slamming in the walls and furniture trying to nip at each other, sometimes to the point where one is quietly whimpering. I don't think they're seriously hurting each other or anything but I would prefer them to play nicer or with some toys. Every time they play too rough I break them up and give them toys to play with. One of them will usually stop playing with their toy and steal the other's, starting the whole thing over again.","My two puppies keep playing rough with each other.

362,Dogtraining,Help please - my parents dog doesn't like me,"My family boxer passed over the rainbow bridge earlier this year and my parents have been fostering boxers from the rescue we're part of in the months since. 

I live out of state and am home for Christmas. Their current pup is a year old and was not properly trained or socialized by his first family. He has settled into the family and they say he's a sweetie.

He doesn't seem to trust me yet. He's been growling on and off without provocation. He'll growl and stare me down, moving closer slowly. He has lunged at me twice and tried to bite at least the second time. 

It's scary because it's not even consistent. I've played tug of war with him, helped with training him for ""sit"" and ""down,"" and bribed him with chicken. 

They expected him to get used to me after a day, since that's how long it took him to be ok with him when he moved in. 

Tonight Dad is going to have me try feeding him and taking the food away and back to establish dominance, but that's several hours from now. Any suggestions on how I can either show I'm not a threat or that I'm the top dog, whichever will be best?

363,Dogtraining,Tips for resource guarding/ territorial behaviors,"I have a 3 year old husky who engages in resource guarding/ territorial behaviors towards other pets/dogs. She often displays this behavior around food, toys, and her crate etc.. She is also very picky/ stubborn and will not eat her food unless she feels like it or when she feels she needs to guard her food. When she is guarding she also does not eat or accept treats and just places them near her food causing her to continue guarding.

We just recently got an 11 week old puppy and have switched to having her bowl of food in her crate, however, this causes her to guard her crate(even when it is closed) and she will display these guarding behaviors. I am trying to teach the puppy to not go near her crate, but I fear for what could happen  if I turn my head and he goes near her crate while she’s guarding. She has snapped at him once over “dropped treats” that were not actually on the ground.

365,Dogtraining,Sudden and Odd Aggressive Behavior,"Hello all,

**A little back story:** I have a 10-month old pitbull (Blue) which I got about 3 months ago. The previous owner had taken Blue to the dog park almost every day (it was right outside of their apartment). They had taken Blue from his mother at 4-weeks old and raised him until I had taken him. They had no more time for him because of 2 young children. Upon meeting the dog, my significant other and I took her Golden Retriever to see if they were compatible. They instantly hit it off and were best friends. No aggression and was the sweetest dog. Unfortunately,  Blue's previous owners let him do whatever so training him was difficult at first. He's made a ton of progress since then. 

**Current:** Through videos and such (and me seeing it with the Golden Retriever), it seemed that Blue was pretty socialized and did well with dogs/cats/and children of all ages. The first time I took him to the dog park, it went very well. The first time he was just getting used to all the new scents. A few times after that he made friends and started finally playing. He had no issues till about 3 weeks ago. A puppy was in the ""big dog"" section and Blue for some odd reason did not like this puppy. He showed some pretty aggressive behavior by walking up the puppy and growling and attacking (he didn't bit the puppy thankfully). I was in shock because this behavior had never been shown before. Of course, I leashed him and walked away. Walking away, another dog had tried attacking the puppy too which I thought was odd. I left and that was that. A week goes and by besides that, Blue hadn't shown any aggression towards anything else so I thought it might have been a freak accident. I decided to take him back to the dog park and once again, another puppy. I kept my eyes on Blue as usual and made sure he didn't go near the puppy. He played with the other dogs and was fine. I was pretty close to him when he started to walk up to the puppy. He exerted once again some aggression (body language mostly) but I immediately stopped it and left. Since then I haven't been back and don't plan on it. I thought maybe it was because he hadn't been neutered and it was some sort of male aggression (but I hadn't seen it with him before). Another person at the dog park had mentioned it could be because he had been taken from his mother so early on but the previous owners sent us videos these last few days with him playing with puppies when they had owned him. 

He already had an appointment to be neutered and was neutered 2 weeks ago. Just these last 2 days he has been showing some more odd signs of aggression. This time when people would pull things out of their bags/put a blanket on he would freak out and bark and show his teeth. Or when guiding him to his cage for bedtime he wouldn't let people touch his collar and showed his teeth. Now to today, I took him on a walk and he was showing his teeth to another dog on the walk when conversating with them.

Could anyone know where this could be coming from? Could this recent aggression be from pain from the neutering? I plan on taking him to the vet to see if there are any other possible medical issues that may be causing this. I was already planning on getting a trainer for us prior to all this happening.

366,Dogtraining,Help with possession aggression?,"Edited for formatting.
Hello all. My spouse and I are the owners of a Husky (3) and a Dachshund (11), I’m not sure if that’s totally important but apparently this is breed typical for both of them.

Husky is food and possession aggressive with toys. He is fed plenty and we’re not really sure what to do, nor why he really does this. He wasn’t ever aggressive to other dogs other than our dachshund when it came to food or anything, he only used to take issue with non-neutered males. Yes, both are neutered. It escalated to one time the Husky attacked the dachshund for walking too close to a treat and broke skin. It took him a while to heal from it and since then there has never been another incident like it. Sometimes he’ll get really really close when the dachshund is eating or drinking though, like hovering over him, and I worry it’s his prey drive. :(

The dachshund is exhibiting possession aggression over… well… me. If the husky comes over innocently for some pets or an ice cube as a treat, the dachshund charges at him, barking and growling. The dachshund is normally a bit yappy, but today he tried to physically attack his husky brother. Twice. We set him in the cage for a time out both times and made sure they were separated to prevent a possible fight. First time was understandable as he was hungry and he got snippy (after time out I made sure he had plenty to eat away from his brother), but the second time I was just letting our Husky and playing with him and the dachshund nearly bit his face. 10 minutes in the cage later and they have been separated for the night.

My question is if anyone has any idea on what we should do? I have a baby due literally next week and if either of them keep up this behavior I think I’ll have a breakdown.","Help with possession aggression? Edited for formatting.

So I'm about to visit someone's family and will stay there for 2 months. They have 4 dogs as of now. Unfortunately due to COVID I couldn't visit them for 2,5 years. Since the last time I visited them, they got another dog (8 months old atm). 
I love dogs and I also have one. I'm not a trainer but I believe the relationship with my dog is good and he listens to me more or less.
This dog I'm about to see now has a tendency to bite people so they plan to keep him on a leash. That I obviously don't want, especially for 2 months, whenever I'm home with them. 
What could you suggest me to do? The person I'm going home with she also hasn't been home for almost 3 months so I was planning to bring dog treat with me so I could exploit the dog's happy moment so he can have a positive memory about me.

373,Dogtraining,How should i react if my dog shows anxiety?,"My rescue is afraid of ""Bangs"" like: fireworks, open a champagne bottle, breaking a glass bottle or door slamming. She also dont like loud arguments.
When this happen, she goes to the bathroom (which she usually do not enter) and stand/ lay in the last corner. Last time she tried to go under a small wardrobe. Sometimes she is shivering, sometimes not. She will eat nothing in this situation.

It is always the bathroom, in every apartment (like parents and friends) not only ours. After one champagner-bottle-opening she now has anxiety to generelly go into the apartment of a good friend of us :(. 

How should i react?

Ignoring sounds hard to me and i dont want to show anxiety too, but how can i show, that she does not has to have anxiety and that i protect her?

The last times i turned on the radio, shut the louvre from the bathroom, give her a blanket and a treat which she eats after the hard stage. 

I am unsure about an axiety-training like playing ""Bang""-Sounds from YouTube so she get used to it because i've read from a risk, that she can finally loose her feeling of a protecting-home. Also a dogtrainer said, that a professional ""bang""-training can lead to more anxiety then fix it. 

She DOES NOT have anxiety of ALL loud sounds. Loud music, a construction site or a helicopter are not the problem. I think she has a trauma from her past life.

374,Dogtraining,Dog keeps running away and cannot be stopped until trapped,"For context, I fostered a dog beginning in March. He was very shut down and came from a South Korean meat farm. Eventually, it came to a point where every potential adopter he would hate and only liked me. Therefore, I adopted him because we clearly had a bond (I couldn’t give him up I loved him) and because He is very scared of pretty much everyone but me. He follows me around everywhere in the house but is still very scared, he can’t be touched unless he is somewhere he feels safe (can NEVER be touched outside). Anyway, in May, his slip lead dropped from my hand for one second and he bolted. He was gone for 26 days. We took every precaution but he takes advantage of every split second mistake. He would run away from me and a rescue group had to trap him. Again In November, he slipped by my mom as she was taking another dog out and he ran away, again for 26 days. He had to be trapped again. He won’t fall for the trap again and I am so deeply scared of losing him. He got hit by a car in his last escape and I fear for him. We are taking every precaution known to man to make sure he never gets the chance but still I want to know if there is anything training wise I can do to help him not run away. I can’t lose my baby again.","Dog keeps running away and cannot be stopped until trapped For context, I fostered a dog beginning in March.

375,Dogtraining,My dog won’t stop chewing my underwear!!,"I have a 7 month old doberman mix. I rescued her at about 5 months old and have been working on a few issues since then, but this habit is proving hard to break. 

She’ll drag my underwear out of the laundry and even open my drawers to get to them. She immediately attacks them on sight, clean or dirty. She’s completely destroyed 3 pairs in 3 days and women’s underwear tends to get pretty expensive. 

I’m not sure what to do about it. As soon as I find them or find her chewing them I’ll grab it, tell her no, and crate her for a little bit. She has other chew toys so I don’t understand the appeal. 

What can I do to fix this? Is there any really good way to combat chewing in general?

edit: I don’t crate as a punishment! it’s more of a “move over so I can clean this up” type thing. Her “house” is right next to my bed and she’s only in there to sleep, while I’m not home, and whenever I’m attending to something she doesn’t need to be wallowing on. She’s currently in there belly up and snoring lol","My dog won’t stop chewing my underwear!! I have a 7 month old doberman mix.

Some background on our dog, and the situation. He is a 4-year old rescue pug, who was rescued from a breeder situation where he was the stud used for breeding. He was in a foster home for about 6 months and has been neutered since then. The rescue said he is housebroken and we got him used to our house, but while we are at my parents for the holiday he has been marking anything. I know the thought is to interrupt when marking and to bring them outside often and offer high value treats for going potty outside, but how long should I expect this to last for? I’m worried it will be harder to retrain our rescue to only go potty outside since he is older, but my parents aren’t going to want him over if he continues to mark their stuff. What kind of training regimine if any, will prevent a dog from marking in places that are new?","4-Year old rescue pug is marking, in unfamiliar places Is this completely normal?

379,Dogtraining,4 month puppy has started alert barking at every sound,"Our 4.5mo old puppy (lab/pit/shepherd mutt, we think) has started alert barking all the time, in just the last week or two. Any sound she can hear outside the house or yard triggers a string of barks - people talking as they walk on the sidewalk, a car door closing three houses away, a police car siren a quarter mile away.

During her socialization phase 8-14 weeks, we played desensitization sounds all the time, and they included basically all the above sounds. She was fine with them back then, and didn't even react to the doorbell.  But as she's hit adolescence she seems to be much more concerned. Maybe because I stopped playing them a month ago?

I plan to go back to playing sounds more frequently again, but I wanted to know if y'all had any other suggestions to help train her to be less concerned about environmental noises.

We do give her tons of exercise and playtime every day, because she's a very high-energy pup. Yesterday included a 3-mile walk and at least two hours of fetch and tug, sunday it was a 5-mile hike plus lots of playtime.

381,Dogtraining,Aggressive Pup,"I have a 2 year old Pekingese and while he is generally sweet, he can get very anxious and aggressive. We have had him since he was 8 weeks old and he was always incredibly sweet, but then he had an accident that caused the removal of his eye at 8 months old and he hasn’t really been the same since. I wouldn’t say his behaviors started immediately after and it could be due to hormones because of his age at the time. Our issues:
-every time my son walks by his kennel (he loves his kennel), he freaks. He starts barking and lunging like he’s trying to break out of his kennel. I am not entirely sure this is unwarranted as my son has autism and displays behaviors that could agitate any dog. Even when my son just calmly walks into the room, however, he still gets upset.
-Sometimes he will randomly attack (by that I mean one bite) if he’s sitting next to you on the couch and you pet him. 
-he is constantly marking his territory (outside but he has accidents inside before). We cannot go on a walk or in a pet store without him pooping AND peeing several times.
-he seems anxious almost all the time. He will lick the air and just looks nervous.
-he is scared of new people…sometimes. He’s met various people in our home and will warm up immediately or run away from them. He seems scared of people when we take him anywhere, which rarely happens.

Besides all of that, he is a silly, goofy, fun little guy that I adore. I’d also like to add that he’s never been aggressive towards me, only my children and my husband. He also gets along great with other dogs (we have a 10 month old golden retriever) and only ever gets snappy if he goes near his food. I’m just at a loss…I know that these behavioral problems are causing him stress and anxiety, but I don’t know how to help him. I’ve thought of taking him to a trainer, but I worry about that increasing his anxiety since he doesn’t like new people.","Aggressive Pup I have a 2 year old Pekingese and while he is generally sweet, he can get very anxious and aggressive.

394,Dogtraining,Dog Behavior Help Plz!,"My fiance and I just got our first house. I brought my dog (3 year old female lab) from my parents 3 dog household. She as never gotten into anything since she was a puppy. No jumping on counters, doesn't mess with any items around the house. About 3 months ago she was getting into small stuff about once a week while we are at work. Since then it's everything. She is jumping on the counters grabbing everything. Remotes, shoes.. even ripped open Christmas presents under the tree with in 5 minutes of taking the trash out. Also, she has been more aggressive. I try and take her on walks and she tries to bite other dogs which is not normal for her. She's always been non aggressive towards other dogs. 

My questions are:
1) what do I do since she does all this when we aren't there. She's an angle while we are present. I don't know how to fix it
2) Would the change of households have anything to do with this?

We are getting a puppy in a few months and I'd like to have her in check before we bring another dog in.

She as never gotten into anything since she was a puppy. No jumping on counters, doesn't mess with any items around the house. About 3 months ago she was getting into small stuff about once a week while we are at work. Since then it's everything. She is jumping on the counters grabbing everything. Remotes, shoes.. even ripped open Christmas presents under the tree with in 5 minutes of taking the trash out. Also, she has been more aggressive. I try and take her on walks and she tries to bite other dogs which is not normal for her. She's always been non aggressive towards other dogs. 

My questions are:
1) what do I do since she does all this when we aren't there. She's an angle while we are present. I don't know how to fix it
2) Would the change of households have anything to do with this?

We are getting a puppy in a few months and I'd like to have her in check before we bring another dog in.

396,Dogtraining,Need some help with cat reactivity,"Any tips are appreciative. We have a 2yo rescue that we've had since he was a puppy. He's grown up with three cats, he's not cat aggressive, and loves to play with our cats. This is fine. 

However, we live in an apartment with a handful of ferals and they like to come to our window/patio to taunt our cats and dog. He goes nuts whenever they're here with high pitched screeching and barking, and it's even worse on walks. I'm afraid sometimes a neighbor is going to report us to animal control for abuse because of the noises he makes. 

He'll also dash towards them and try to get them to play, tugging as hard as he can on the leash to get to them. They give zero fucks about him and don't run or even react. We've tried to keep them away from the house, they won't go and even then we can't keep them out of the whole complex. This somewhat extends to lizards, but not nearly as bad. Probably related to prey drive since he's a part pittie, but doesn't seem aggressive. 

What are some methods to break him of this? Keeping in mind it's going to be incredibly hard to do when outside due to trying to not disturb the peace while we stand in one spot for five minutes trying to calm him down.","Need some help with cat reactivity Any tips are appreciative.

397,Dogtraining,Do I discipline poor behavior from my old dog towards new puppy?,"Hi,   


I'm trying to help my new dog and old dog get along. My old dog is downright interpreting play signs as aggression and is clearly trying to bite or hurt new dog. Old dog is giving off mixed signals, will be wagging his tail and seem to be reacting well, but if the puppy comes near his front he will not nip but try to outright bite, or hurt the other dog and start profusely growling.  


How do we handle aggression from old dog to new dog, whether it be growl, bite, etc? More importantly how do I not handle this?","Do I discipline poor behavior from my old dog towards new puppy? Hi,

398,Dogtraining,Using the dog's name in commands or not?,"I have a couple questions which I did google but they're kind of specific. I have experience with basic training of labs and goldens which mostly train themselves but approaching retirement and want to make it more of a serious hobby with a new dog which might not be a retriever. Maybe boarder collie.

Should I use ""\[dog's name\] come"" or just ""come""? In both situations where we're alone or with lots of dogs around. Does it matter and is the dog really listening for the words or the owners voice and maybe not it's name? It was hard to tell with retrievers because they're so smart they could read my mind. I know collies are smart too but I understand they make more decisions on their own so maybe it matters.

The other thing is voice and hand commands. Trained our recent golden hand commands which worked great when she went deaf. Anyway, once both are learned is it OK to just casually use one or the other or both with no consistency or does this confuse the dog?

399,Dogtraining,Resource guarding.,"My 6 month puppy has become very sensitive around my partner.  She's gotten worse and worse and now she will snap at him if he touches trash on the floor or moves his hands quickly especially if she's chewing on him. She never growls first and he says she hasn't bitten hard. For the last couple months I've been very firm, don't take anything from her unless you swap or it could kill her. I'm primary caregiver and she's always been naughtier around him, jumps on him and bites harder. She lets me take anything from her and only guards when it's very valuable. Unfortunately we can't puppy proof our place better because it's too small. He's definitely never abused her. 

I've started involving him in training more and having him hand feed her. I also started holding her by the harness and giving her kibble for being calm while he moves his hands around and touches things on the floor. Does this sound okay? Do I stop completely when she goes over threshold or keep going? I'm thinking I'll need to bring a trainer in because we're expecting in the summer but that's going to need to wait.","Resource guarding.

400,Dogtraining,"Puppy barks to go outside to pee, does not pee","My puppy pretty much exclusively barks because he needs to pee and doesn't want to go in his confined space (play pen or kennel). We've been training him to go outside on puppy pads, and if we catch him when he's got to go but not barking (figuring out his potty bells, reaching for his leash, etc) he goes right away the moment we get outside. But if he's barking because he needs to go, we'll go outside and he just lays down and acts like he needs to sleep. Then we come in and he's jumping and barking, so we take him back out, and he lays right back down outside. We can do this half a dozen times, and he won't pee. But, if we then start ignoring the barking, and turn away from him or shush him, he pees pretty instantly inside.

Does anyone have any idea why he's doing this or what we could do to stop it?

401,Dogtraining,Dog bites when excite,"Hi Reddit! I have a German Shepherd, Lab, Husky mix and for the most part he’s a good boy.

Just whatever experiences someone has with this, or if anyone has anything that can help I would appreciate it.","Dog bites when excite Hi Reddit!

402,Dogtraining,Help crate training a rescue!,"Hi all--apologies for the lengthy post to come but I want to be as detailed as possible. I keep getting the same advice too, so please read the full before suggesting a Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

I rescued a 2 y.o. pug-mix about a week and a half ago. She was found, abandonned with some other dogs so we don't know her full history but she took to new people and fostered very well. She's my first dog ever and I love her! And in almost every way she's been incredibly easy--she is friendly and quiet around all sorts of new people or other animals. She's attached to me and 90% of the time follows me around the house and finds a spot so sleep nearby (she would do the same with other adults in my household if I'm gone). Her foster mom described her has ""submissive,"" she just goes with the flow and adapts to any new situation you put her in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only area she's giving me a hard time is crate training. I always planned on crate training a dog; I have vets in my family who use crates and can't say enough good things about them but my dog seems to hate hers. I set up a crate for her in my bedroom. She was kenneled at her foster's house and did fine, although she was around other dogs and the foster mom eventually let her sleep in bed. 

&amp;#x200B;

At first I started crating full on, figuring she could handle it--leaving her alone for half an hour to an hour and trying to get her to sleep in the crate. I've pretty much given up on the latter since I wasn't getting any sleep and she wasn't whining for any reason I could tell other then wanting to sleep with me.  Now I've started a slower approach with training and meals in the crate but I still need a way to keep her safe when she's alone.  

&amp;#x200B;

She has escaped three times now! Including when I put a baby lock on the crate door, she just squeezed out of it.  It terrifies me that she'll hurt herself trying to escape so I don't want to force the issue, but she also seems way more keyed up when I come back and she's been roaming my room (digging at the door, whining). I've tried toys (she's totally uninterested even outisde of the crate) and treats (she will ignore them until I come back and let her out of the crate, at which point she'll take the treat out of the crate and eat it elsewhere). 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels worth mentioning she's ""caught on"" to parts of being confined. She'll totally cower and try to avoid me when she sees me coming to pick up her up for the crate. Or even at night, if I leave her in my room to go brush my teeth for longer then 5 minutes and come back to the room, she runs out the door and is scared to come back in -- convinced I'm going to leave her alone again! I have never punished her with the crate (hell I've never punished her anyway, she's so well behaved) and I try and keep coming and going as low key as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is she's so good in every other way. She hasn't had any accidents or chewed anything in or out of the crate when left alone. And she's so quiet you can hardly hear her whining (she barks sometimes but even that it's hard to hear).  She has had occasions times where she barks or cries for 5 minutes and then seems to self soothe but the escaping implies to me she hates every minute of the crate. We have a really good, regular routine with lots of exercise and bonding time but eventually I have to go back to my full time work and crate her for at least parts of the day (not to mention life in general where the crate could come in handy). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try a door gate instead to my room? Or will she hurt herself trying to break that too? Do I get some military grade crate (seems absurd for an 8lb pug)? And with the crate training in general, am I pushing her too far? How do I leave her alone safely otherwise while training her slowly? It's not an option to give her free reign in the house (there's a cat, rooms she shouldn't get into etc) but I don't want to increase any anxieties that are underlying right now.

403,Dogtraining,"My friends have the worst behaved dog, and I felt like I was the one being trained","Just visited a friend with their young dog - easily the worst behaved dog I've ever met, and felt miserable feeling like *I* was the one being trained how to behave around it Just need a moment to vent here.

I love and grew up with dogs, my parents always had at least one in the house my entire life. Maybe we were lucky but we never went out of our way to train them. At worst, they all begged for food, didn't have the best recall, and one jumps quite a bit - although we recognize that it's our fault for feeding them scraps from the table, or letting them jump up to put their paws on our chest to have a biiig stretch.

As puppies if they ever bit or acted aggressively it was always an immediate ""bop"" or hit on the nose and vocal ""BAD"" or ""NO"" - whether or not that's correct our dogs were all amazing and never aggressive (aside from one difficult rescue that was leash-aggressive and didn't like kids - but we always took precautions and went out of our way to keep others safe).

ANYWAY - that's all to say that I feel like I have a pretty good sense of dog etiquette - how dogs should behave and how I should interact with them - even though I get that every dog is different and every owner has their own relationship with them.

My friend's dog was the worst behaved dog I've ever met. Even years ago when I met her as a young puppy, she constantly barked and bit people. I did not enjoy being around this puppy, and who doesn't like puppies? Even a long walk in the woods wouldn't distract her from biting and jumping on you.

Most recently the dog was still constantly biting and nipping. We met first outside of their house and went for a walk. Not sure how to describe it - she didn't seem angry or scared of me - but it was definitely aggressive in the way that was like really rough play or establishing dominance - but she wasn't humping at all. It was incredibly annoying. And we were walking, which just felt so weird to me that she was so infatuated with jumping on and biting me.

My instinct - whether from my own experience with my  dogs, or an innate reaction to being BIT - was to quickly give her a firm ""bop"" on the nose with a firm ""NO"". *This is where my friend began to train me.* They said her command is not ""no"" but a loud ""AH"", and not to hit her and not to pull away when she bites, because it encourages her. This bothered me - you should not have to train every house guest how to interact with your misbehaved dog...

Later, they had more guests over and the dog was barking and biting all of the guests as we sat around the table - right in the back of our arms, I have bruises from it. Every time she would get riled up and start biting and barking, my friend would give her a bone to chew to distract her. She would plow through the bone and get up and start biting and barking again, and then they would give her another one to keep her busy and not bother us. During the 3 hours we were hanging out I counted over 4 bones, and this was right after her dinner, and she was loudly burping for the rest of the night. As I said, I'm not a dog expert, but not only were they very obviously encouraging this behavior by rewarding her with a bone every time she acted out, it also just doesn't seem healthy for her.

Am I wrong? I'm not going to tell someone they're training their dog wrong, or encouraging bad behavior, especially as a guest in their home. But you should not have to train a guest how to react to your dog biting them, or expect them to speak your dog's cryptic language.

Any tips as a guest for how to deal with a dog like this?

Part of me feels bad because my friend also grew up with dogs, and they themselves said that this dog is the worst behaved dog they've ever met. The dog is wild, but I really think my friend is making the situation much worse by the strange training they give it. They are very strict with the dog, but its just not the kind of training I'm used to. They also say things like ""when it's just me she's so chill"" or ""if she weren't so big she'd get away with a lot more"" - but don't seem to recognize that the way they interact with her and have ""trained"" her could be a huge factor in the ongoing behavior.

404,Dogtraining,Puppy biting,"Hey guys!

Recently picked up a kelpie cross boarder collie and the first week went okay. He was nipping a bit but that’s understandable being a 9 week puppy so we tried redirecting with toys. This worked at first but now he bypassed the toy and goes straight for your hands. We then watch a McCann dog training video saying to hold his collar and his body to calm him which seemed to work at first but now going for his collar only seems to aggravate him more.

We tried time outs but again trying to hook his collar on a leash causes biting. Trying to take him off his leash from punishment for biting results in more biting. His puppy teeth are sharp and have drawn blood on multiple occasions. He’s now at a point where you can’t pat him without expecting a nip.

We can’t get him into a puppy school until the new year and our patience is running very thin. If you have any advice or tips I would very much love to hear them!","Puppy biting Hey guys!

His puppy teeth are sharp and have drawn blood on multiple occasions. He’s now at a point where you can’t pat him without expecting a nip.

We can’t get him into a puppy school until the new year and our patience is running very thin. If you have any advice or tips I would very much love to hear them!"
405,Dogtraining,Aggression is scaring me,"I don’t really know where to start… so maybe here. We have a Male, intact 1.5yr old GSDxNorthern Inuit in the UK.

We moved to a new part of the country when he was around 1 and was previously well established with the local group of dogs and their owners with great relationships and regular play dates so we were keen to find new ones in our next home.
We met numerous friendly dogs and made friends with most, however a certain group of older male dogs belonging to one person really took a dislike to him, chasing him out of the park and onto the road when he was off leash a couple of times. (Owners did nothing)

One time I had him on leash and the biggest+smallest of the group ran at us, attacked him and when I couldn’t drop his lead due to being tangled, the fight resulted in my dog doing quite considerable damage to them both.

Since then, OUR dog started being aggressive. Still Very casual on walks, does not bark or show any interest in other dogs while heeling. But when brought close to SOME dogs (can’t figure out a pattern) would start to posture or maybe low growl.
If off leash he will run over to sniff Butts, as we would on a play date with a friend, then stands alongside them with his tail raised before just… going for them. For that reason we tend not to let him off anymore unless we can be sure there are no strange dogs.

Today I was walking him on his normal leash, when a dog (on short leash) walked around the corner 30m away from behind wooded cover, he pulled the lead out of my hand. And did the sniff, stand, then attack before I could get there.

I’m very shaken and upset, he was very well socialised, friendly and confident with all dogs until this point, is not afraid of any of the typical things, very keen to please and still loves playing with dogs he knows.
He gets at least 2x45 min thorough exercise sessions every day, running, fetching and tug of war with mental stimulation in the evenings.

My partner wants to castrate, I’m reluctant in case it’s anxiety based.

416,EatCheapAndHealthy,TIP: Buy whole chicken - not chicken parts,"Most posts in this subreadit are asking for advice. Instead, today I want to offer a tip that has worked really well for me:

I stopped buying chicken breast or chicken wings. Instead, I buy whole chickens and I watched a few YouTube tutorials to learn how to cut the chicken myself. One whole chicken nets 2 breasts, 2 tenders, 4 wing pieces, 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, and I use the leftover carcass and wing tips to make chicken broth, which yields soups or can be used to make rice. Every part of the chicken can be used for something.

In my local Walmart, whole chickens are around $1/lb while chicken breast and chicken tenders are $2 - $4/lb, thighs are $2.3 - $2.9/lb, drumsticks are $1.3 - $2.0 / lb, and wings are $4 / lb. Trust me, the weight of the backbone is not reason for the price difference. Chicken pieces cost more because you are paying someone else to cut them for you. Another factor is that in the US people have a strange preference for white meat (chefs prefer dark meat bc it's tastier) and that makes chicken breast in particular very expensive.

In my case, I've gone even further. I bought myself a $30 manual meat grinder and now I buy whole turkeys, cut out the meat, and I make my own ground meat. The whole turkey is $1 / lb here, while ground turkey meat is $3 / lb. I only use the turkey breast to make ground meat because it's very easy to cut. I eat the turkey legs separately (cooked in the oven), and I make broth with the remainder of the turkey.

You don't have to go as far as I did (i.e. meat grinding). Just learning to cut a chicken can slash your meat budget by a factor of 3; and for most of us, meat is the most expensive grocery.

I hope this helps someone out there.","TIP: Buy whole chicken - not chicken parts Most posts in this subreadit are asking for advice. Instead, today I want to offer a tip that has worked really well for me:

420,EatCheapAndHealthy,Meal-prep salad opinion - how many days would this low-calorie bean and veg salad last?,"If I made enough of this chickpea salad for a week (i.e. one portion day), would they last for the full week in the fridge without going off?

**Ingredients:**

**Veg (all raw unless specified):**
- mushrooms
- broccoli
- carrots
- red onion
- bell peppers
- green beans (microwaved)
- peas (microwaved)
- tomatoes
- cucumber

**Legumes:**
- canned cooked chickpeas
- canned cooked black beans

**Dressing / sauce:**
- lemon juice
- olive oil
- salt
- black pepper
- basil leaves

**Instructions:**
- dice all veg (after cooking those necessary) into bitesize chunks
- add them to a big mixing bowl
- strain and add the canned legumes to that same bowl
- add eye-balled / to taste amounts of the dressing ingredients
- mix together, and dole out into 7 separate containers
- put into fridge to chill until ready to eat (cold)

Is this a possibility? By day 2-3 the veg would be a little softer, and some of it would have oxidised (I guess?) and thus turned a bit brown (specifically the mushrooms), taking on a stronger / B.O.ish smell (any idea why that is?

432,EatCheapAndHealthy,Fruit Leather Guide,"Fruit Leather is a great way to make fruit last longer and to get your non-fruit-loving people to eat it. It's best made with a dehydrator, but you can also make it in your oven (I've also read about leaving it covered in the sun for several hours, but I'll let you decide if that's going to give you food poisoning or not).

You can use most fruits for this. The result will be a leather or crunchy chip, depending on how long you dry it for. I've tried a number of different fruits and the only one I will warn against is watermelon - tried it as a lark and it's just crunchy sugar. I really like strawberries and blueberries mixed together.

Our dehydrator is a round Cosori model and cost about $70. It's about 3 years old now and we've made beef jerky, fruit Leather, and plenty of other dehydrated foods with it. It has paid for itself already. You will need solid tray inserts for it (ours came with 2, I found 3 more online).

The last batch I made used 1 package of fresh strawberries (use frozen if they're cheaper) and 2 packs of blueberries. Rinse everything, toss any nasty ones, remove the leaves from the strawberries, dump them into a food processor or blender (processor works better) and puree them. Pour them onto the trays as thick as you can, spreading them evenly. If you go too thin, they stick to the tray and are hard to remove.

Check the recipe book for your dehydrator for time and temp. Ours was 8 hours at 165°F (70-75°C). If not fully dry, peel off, flip over on the tray, and give another hour or two.","Fruit Leather Guide Fruit Leather is a great way to make fruit last longer and to get your non-fruit-loving people to eat it.

435,EatCheapAndHealthy,Chickpea and Butter Bean mash,"I eat this pretty much everyday and since recommended the recipe a lot to my flatmates who’ve enjoyed it too! Very earthy but light. 

Ingredients - can of chickpeas, can of butter beans, creme freshe, bacon (or choice of substitute), (all sorts of alternates listed below. 

1.) Fry the bacon (sometimes I do this but with an egg as well, or without bacon completely)

2.) Then add some butter to the pan to deglaze it abit. 

3.) Add chickpeas and butter beans in a little bit of butter with pepper and salt.

4.) Cook till their golden and light brown. The shells will start to slip off the butter beans that’s a good sign.

5.) Take them off the heat and into a bowl (it’s best to use a food processor apparently but i don’t have one) then mash with a fork and fold in the creme freshe! 

(interesting if you fry some chorizo instead of the bacon and you can cook the beans in the chorizo fat. But chorizo is abit expensive) 

my flatmate cracks and egg into the actual mix ! but i can’t say it looked very appealing. (egg theme week!) 

occasionally this is quite a nice side dish with a meatier meal like a steak or gammon or something.","Chickpea and Butter Bean mash I eat this pretty much everyday and since recommended the recipe a lot to my flatmates who’ve enjoyed it too! Very earthy but light.

Non-perishable:

Chia seeds ( superfood that thickens the oatmeal)
Old fashioned oats (substance of the oatmeal)

Buy weekly:

Fat free milk (almond / cashew / oat milk work just fine)
Fat free Plain Greek Yogurt (this is to make it creamy)

In a container, mix in 1/4 cup of oats, with 1 tsp of chia seeds, 1 Tblsp Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of milk. Mix all together and leave in fridge overnight and up to 5 days. To serve, add 1/3 cup of hot or cold milk and mix again for a delicious serving of creamy oatmeal.

I usually make 5 portions on Sunday night to last me all week. I use this recipe as a canvas to explore flavors and toppings. On weight lifting days, I mix in a scoop of protein power. Sometimes I add vanilla or almond extract and honey. During the summer I add frozen berries and honey. On cold days I add cinnamon and brown sugar. You can add nuts, bananas, peanut butter, fruit preserves, chocolate chips, dry fruit, fresh fruits and anything that sounds good to you. 

The cost per portion is $2.00, which includes one large container of oats($5), one lb bag of chia seeds ($10), 1 gallon of milk ( $12) and 3 large containers of yogurt ($15) for a whole month (approx 20-22 servings) plus any toppings you desire.

I'm working on a project where I have to develop 5-ingredient vegan recipes and WHEW, it's been challenging. But also rewarding to find ways to make super tasty meals without many ingredients.

The first one I did was a beet 'ricotta' dumpling with dilly plant-based yogurt which we loved, but I made these white beans last night, and they were amazing! Today I'm doing a fun roasted red pepper mushroom ragu.

A few notes, when I do these... I don't include water, salt, pepper, or oil in my ingredient count (mainly because these ingredients show up in nearly every single recipe and they are kitchen staples for most households, so they don't count toward my ingredient limit thank god, haha). 

Here's how I made it!

Ingredients:

* 1 pound dry small white beans, soaked for 2–3 hours.  (Note, you can also use (2) 15-ounce cans of white beans in this recipe)
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs of celery, with leaves, diced
* 1 tablespoon hot or mild curry powder
* 6 cups water
* 15-ounce can coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Soak the beans:**

* Cover the beans with water and soak for at least 2 hours. Drain off the water and set aside.

**Cook the aromatics:**

* Heat the neutral oil in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 7–8 minutes until softened. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the curry powder and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the beans:**

Add the beans to the pot and toss to coat with the curry powder. Season with salt. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours or until the beans are tender (timing will depend on bean variety). If using canned beans, cook only 30 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. 

**Finish the beans:**

Pour in the coconut milk and simmer for an additional 10 minutes. Taste and season once more.

**To serve:**

Serve with crusty bread or fresh herbs, if you like.","5-ish ingredient white bean curry! So cheap, so easy! PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/y8gCn9X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y8gCn9X.jpg)

**Recipe here originally:** [**Spicy Chicken Peanut Udon Stir-Fry**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/spicy-chicken-peanut-udon-stir-fry/)

This is such an easy udon recipe and it's SO good. I really liked the Brussels sprouts in this dish, even more than regular cabbage. Though, you could use shredded cabbage too! Or even sliced bok choy.

**Substitutions:**

**Udon:** Any noodle. Try it with soba, ramen, or rice noodles. Can also use pasta, like spaghetti or linguine in a pinch.

**Ground chicken:** Your favorite ground meat or use finely chopped tofu or store-bought tofu crumbles.

**Brussels sprouts:** Cabbage or bok choy

## Ingredients

* 16 ounces fresh, frozen, or dry udon
* ¼ cup vegetable oil divided plus more if needed
* 1 pound ground chicken
* 2 shallots peeled and minced
* 8 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts trimmed and thinly sliced
* ⅔ cup water
* ¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons peanut butter
* 1 tablespoon chili oil or sriracha plus more, to taste
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For serving:

* Crushed peanuts optional

## Instructions

## Cook the udon:

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the udon and cook according to package instructions. Drain, rinse and set aside.

## Cook the chicken:

* Heat half the vegetable oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 8–12 minutes until it browns around the edges and is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the chicken to a bowl.

## Cook the aromatics:

* Add the remaining oil. Add the shallot and cook for 3–5 minutes–often stirring–until it softens and begins to turn golden brown. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of chicken.

## Cook the Brussels sprouts:

* If needed, add another drizzle of oil. Add the Brussels sprouts and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 4–6 minutes until the sprouts begin to char around the edges. Stir regularly.

## Prepare the sauce:

* As the Brussels sprouts cook, prepare the sauce. Whisk together the water or stock in a bowl with soy sauce, peanut butter, chili oil, mirin, and sesame oil. Set aside.

## Finish the udon:

* Pour the sauce into the Brussels sprouts and bring to a boil for 2–3 minutes. Add the chicken, garlic, and shallot and toss to coat. Cook until the sauce thickens slightly.
* Add the cooked udon to the wok and toss to coat for 1-3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season the udon to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Divide the cooked udon between bowls and garnish with crushed peanuts. Enjoy!","Thinly sliced Brussels sprouts are amazing in stir-fries!

I’ve seen this topic come up on this sub a few times and figured I’d make a post on it. A lot of people post stuff like “I have $20 to last me until my first paycheck in 3 weeks, what should I eat?” I want to encourage you to look for food pantries in your area and use their services. 

All this is from my experience in a mid-sized US city; things may work differently elsewhere, but most of the general ideas still apply. 

**tl;dr if you think you could possibly benefit from visiting a food bank, food pantry, or other free/reduced cost food organization, please do.** The people who work there want you to use it. You are not “taking away” food from people who “need it more”, because 1) everyone needs and deserves to eat and 2) often there is enough or too much food—the resources food banks are short on are more to do with insufficient funding, and more clients = more money allocated to them.  

I have volunteered for a couple months at a food pantry, but it is part of a larger organization I have volunteered at for years doing other food-related work (largely cooking and distributing hot meals), so I get to see how food donations come in and how we sort and allocate them. The organization I volunteer at serves a lot of needs in the community but one of their target populations is homeless youth, which is the demographic served by the hot meal program. The food pantry program serves a wider range of people (I started volunteering there because they need someone who speaks Spanish, and I’m unemployed now so the scheduling works out well). I also sometimes unload and sort donations from grocery stores and the city food bank, which in addition to providing food to individuals, also distributes it to other organizations throughout the city. 

Some things that I’ve noticed that might surprise people:

* we often have too much food. By this I mean we get donated much more food than we have the capacity to cook, or people do not take all the food we serve. 

* On the rare occasion we do run out of food, it is more likely that we didn’t plan to cook enough, or had an unexpected influx of clients; I can’t think of a time that the hot meal program ran out of raw ingredients. (The food pantry and hot meal program share ingredients and distribute them as needed.) 

* The food pantry will often run out of high-demand items like milk, eggs, and culturally specific staple foods (like masa harina amongst the Hispanic clients) but even when this happens there is often an excess of other items that are perfectly good, just a little less familiar. The food pantry had two huge boxes of bok choy go nearly untouched this week; it got distributed to other sites so it’s not going to waste, but people were preferring to take fruits and veggies they knew how to cook and that their families would recognize. We’ve had the same cans of puréed pumpkin sitting on the self for weeks; there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just less familiar to people so they gravitate towards other items. 

* There are nice, high-quality foods available, including a mix of fresh, frozen, and shelf-stable foods. We get lots of donations from Whole Foods and local stores in a similar price range, so there are many vegan and gluten-free options available as well as some really tasty baked goods and ready-to-eat meals. This time of year, grocery stores are going overboard on cookies for the holidays, so we have lots of those, to the point where volunteers are encouraged to take them home because we can’t give them away fast enough. 

* Speaking of which—volunteers and staff eat the same food as clients, because it is good food. Nothing is gross or bad—sometimes it is past the sell-by date but we have government guidelines as to how long different items stay safe to eat past their sell-by dates. For example, we keep milk for a week after its sell-by date and throw it out after. A lot of stuff has not even reached its sell-by date but has some minor issue like the package being dented, it’s still perfectly good to eat.  

* We are not judging you for using our services. If you have special needs like allergies or religious food restrictions, we will try to find something for you. Of course there are jerks working in every industry, but in general, if someone chooses to work or volunteer for a food pantry or other free food program, it is because they want to help, and believe everyone deserves enough to eat. 

In general, American grocery stores have tons of perfectly good ingredients they can’t sell for whatever reason, and we usually get more than enough donated. Where nonprofit food programs have shortages is often in other areas—they can’t hire enough full time staff to keep food pantries open more than a few hours a week, or pay their staff enough to prevent burnout and high turnover. Or they can’t afford equipment, vehicles, real estate, etc. The food itself is unlikely to be what’s limiting them; they need money, and nonprofits get funding based on use. By using the food pantry, you are directly contributing to them being able to get more funds and provide more/better services. It’s not a direct 1:1 relationship between clients and funding but they will put things like “x number of clients used our services this year” in grant applications, and a higher number will lead to more money for them.  

So please—if you are in the position of having to feed yourself and/or others with very little money, while this sub can be a great resource on how to do that cheaply, please please please see what is available in your community and do not hesitate to make use of it! It is there for you. You can always volunteer or donate in the future when you’re doing better; for now, you need to eat and you deserve to eat well, and we want to help you. 

Start by searching “food bank” or “free food” plus your zip code or city. 

(And if you’re reading this as someone who is a little better off and wants to help, know that the best way to assist food banks is with cash donations. Volunteering is great too; I’m happy to answer questions about my experience if you are wondering!)

There are programs for you but you may have to search for them. 

As a side note—it’s true there are various factors in the way social programs are funded that mean sometimes people are turned away from services they need. That is not a reflection on you, it doesn’t mean you’re not deserving. It is a systemic issue and often the people doing the on-the-ground work wish we had more flexibility to serve more people. Definitely keep trying and looking for food resources that will help you if some of them turn you away.","As a regular volunteer, please use food pantries!

I've been using my local pantry due to inflation and they have standard boxes that they distribute. Every week I can expect onions and celery but the rest of the produce box is usually a surprise. The only problem is that I don't use onions every day in my cooking and I'm starting to get quite the little stack of onions. The only thing I make with lots of onions is mujadara, and as much as I love it, I can't eat it every week.

I have some basics such as dried oats, peanut butter, tuna packets, etc… but I would love to hear some other suggestions! 

Thank you!"

473,EatCheapAndHealthy,Sauerkraut,"Yesterday, I tried making red cabbage sauerkraut for the first time! 

I haven't ever tried, but have read that the lacto-fermentation that takes place, helps with IBS symptoms, from which I suffer quite regularly...

I have put it in a jar with a cloth on top and it is sitting on the counter as we speak.

Do I need to look for something else? To do something every x time, or really anything else? I have put a big cabbage leaf on top as weight, so all is submerged in its juice. 

Also, I haven't measured exactly how much salt I used, but juice was quickly released, so I thought it was ok. Will there be any problem if I used less or more than needed?

Any suggestions welcome!!!

491,EatCheapAndHealthy,meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget,"&amp;#x200B;

[making mondays \(taste\) great again with allll the veggies!!](https://preview.redd.it/ew37wzkchd581.jpg?width=1530&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af799fa387216b53b0f293026f1b3dfb93386f0)

meat is always the most expensive ingredient in week day meals. For making meatless Mondays as flavorful as any other night of the week, you need all the veggie flavor profiles you can get -- the more the merrier :)

this is a great meal to make because you can roast all the veggies on one pan (minimal mess making), and throw whatever leftovers you have in your fridge on top. makes enough veggies for at least 3 bowls, so you’ll have lunch for the next two days. You can use frozen cauliflower or brussels if you're ballin' on a budget, just make sure to defrost before roasting!

**ingredients:**

* cauliflower
* brussel sprouts
* 1 sweet (or regular) potato
* tomatoes
* cheese (I like goat)
* dressing
* spices for seasoning: salt, pepper, garlic
* optional: chili powder, cumin, curry powder, squeeze of lemon juice
* Other topping options: green onions, kale, cucumbers, roasted chickpeas, sesame seeds, balsamic glaze, croutons, literally any leftovers in your fridge

**recipe:** Preheat oven to 450. Cut Brussels in half and sweet potatoes into fourths, break up cauliflower florets into smaller pieces. Put everything onto a pan and drizzle with olive oil and salt. For the Brussels and cauliflower: also sprinkle garlic, pepper, and whatever other spices you want (I like cumin and chili &amp; curry powder on the cauliflower). bake the veggies for about 20-25 minutes, depending on desired crispiness. The sweet potatoes will need an extra ten minutes or so. When the veggies are done cooking, make your bowls! Toppings are essential, I always love tomatoes and cucumbers for some fresher flavors, plus goat cheese for some tanginess. Use whatever dressing you want on top to bring everything together — balsamic glaze/dressing always slaps!

I’d love to hear your suggestions for other veggies or toppings to add — especially if you have some suggestions to add crunch like croutons?? hope you all give it a try! :)","meatless Mondays (or any day really) -- veggie bowls for any budget &amp;#x200B;

502,EatCheapAndHealthy,Carrot ricotta dumplings! You only need a few ingredients...a little time-consuming but a great way to use up carrots...the Recipe makes about 50 dumplings for around $6.50.,"PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg)

Recipe here originally: [Carrot Ricotta Dumplings](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/carrot-ricotta-dumplings/) 

Here's what you need:

* 1 ½ pounds carrots peeled and sliced into rounds ($2.69)
* 2 eggs ($.36)
* 16 ounces ricotta cheese ($2.89)
* 1¼ cup flour plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper

# Instructions:

#### Boil the carrots:

* Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the carrots and cook until completely soft. You should be able to mash them easily against the side of the pot.
* Drain the carrots through a sieve and run cold water over them. You can put a few ice cubes on top of the carrots to speed up the process. Once the carrots are cool enough to handle, use a potato masher to mash them until completely smooth. Alternatively, you can use a food processor or ricer.

#### Bring a pot of water to a boil:

* Wipe out the pot used to cook the carrots and fill it with water again. Transfer to the stovetop and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.

#### Prepare the ricotta mixture:

* In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add the ricotta and whisk until incorporated with the eggs—season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the dumpling mixture:

* Pour the ricotta over the carrots. Add the flour. Use a spoon or an electric hand-mixer to blend until combined. Do not overmix! The mixture should hold its shape but should not feel too doughy. It should still be a bit 'wet' from the ricotta. If the mixture feels too loose, add more flour in 1 tablespoon increments.

#### Taste the dumplings:

* Once the water is boiling, drop a small pinch of the dumpling mixture into the pot. Once it floats, take it out and taste it. Adjust the seasonings in your ricotta dumpling mixture to taste.

#### Boil the dumplings:

* Use a teaspoon to scoop a spoonful of the mixture and run the edge of the spoon against the inside of the bowl to form a quenelle shape. These need not be perfect. With the dumpling mixture still on your spoon, place the spoon right into the boiling water and shake it to loosen the dumpling off the spoon.
* Continue until you have about 5–6 dumplings in the pot. Allow them to boil for 3–4 minutes until they float. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large plate once cooked through. Alternatively, you can roll the mixture into balls between your hands and drop them right into the water. Again, be careful not to over-roll them, or the dumpling will be tough.
* Continue boiling the dumplings in batches until all the dumplings have been cooked.

At this point, you can serve with your favorite sauce (I did maple-sage) like a butter sauce or even simple tomato sauce. Any remaining cooked and un-sauced dumplings can be frozen. Arrange them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and place them in the freezer for 3 hours. Once they are frozen, transfer them to a gallon freezer bag. The dumplings will keep for 1 month in the freezer.","Carrot ricotta dumplings! You only need a few ingredients...a little time-consuming but a great way to use up carrots...the Recipe makes about 50 dumplings for around $6.50. PIC: [https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sRSW4vg.jpg)

Recipe here originally: [Carrot Ricotta Dumplings](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/carrot-ricotta-dumplings/) 

Here's what you need:

* 1 ½ pounds carrots peeled and sliced into rounds ($2.69)
* 2 eggs ($.36)
* 16 ounces ricotta cheese ($2.89)
* 1¼ cup flour plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper

# Instructions:

#### Boil the carrots:

* Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the carrots and cook until completely soft. You should be able to mash them easily against the side of the pot.
* Drain the carrots through a sieve and run cold water over them. You can put a few ice cubes on top of the carrots to speed up the process. Once the carrots are cool enough to handle, use a potato masher to mash them until completely smooth. Alternatively, you can use a food processor or ricer.

#### Bring a pot of water to a boil:

* Wipe out the pot used to cook the carrots and fill it with water again. Transfer to the stovetop and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.

#### Prepare the ricotta mixture:

* In a small bowl, whisk the eggs until smooth. Add the ricotta and whisk until incorporated with the eggs—season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the dumpling mixture:

* Pour the ricotta over the carrots. Add the flour. Use a spoon or an electric hand-mixer to blend until combined. Do not overmix! The mixture should hold its shape but should not feel too doughy. It should still be a bit 'wet' from the ricotta. If the mixture feels too loose, add more flour in 1 tablespoon increments.

#### Taste the dumplings:

* Once the water is boiling, drop a small pinch of the dumpling mixture into the pot. Once it floats, take it out and taste it. Adjust the seasonings in your ricotta dumpling mixture to taste.

#### Boil the dumplings:

* Use a teaspoon to scoop a spoonful of the mixture and run the edge of the spoon against the inside of the bowl to form a quenelle shape. These need not be perfect. With the dumpling mixture still on your spoon, place the spoon right into the boiling water and shake it to loosen the dumpling off the spoon.
* Continue until you have about 5–6 dumplings in the pot. Allow them to boil for 3–4 minutes until they float. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a large plate once cooked through.

505,EatCheapAndHealthy,Healthier Snacks,"So I'm a very picky eater, I try everything ofcourse, and for years I've tried alot of healthy foods but never stick with them because they either don't taste good enough to stick with, or it doesn't really fill me up at all and I will crave unhealthy snacks anyway.

I even tried just ignoring my hunger and eat less, but for some reason that will make me very tired and I even fall asleep at my desk at work. 

It also doesn't help that most healthy snacks I find online, need to be prepared. And I know it will sound cliché, but I'm a very busy person, I don't always have the time to prepare a healthy snack. The best part about the unhealthier snacks is that, you can just grab it, and eat it.

Just some quick snacks, I ofcourse already know about the basic options like fruits, nuts, dry fruit, frozen fruit etc.","Healthier Snacks So I'm a very picky eater, I try everything ofcourse, and for years I've tried alot of healthy foods but never stick with them because they either don't taste good enough to stick with, or it doesn't really fill me up at all and I will crave unhealthy snacks anyway.

I never know what to get my grandparents on my mother’s side. They are a very traditional, old money type of couple. They had decent wealth in their youth but ended up losing a lot. They still have the means to buy themselves almost whatever they please. They don’t particularly like me, so in turn they don’t put much effort into getting me a gift. I usually reciprocate that effort. This year I just wanted to make a little more effort and hopefully mend our relationship a bit. I don’t have much interest in being fully acquainted with them; I just want Christmas/in-general to be less awkward. What should I get? I’m 21 work in tech and live in norcal/bay. They are 70 and 74 and live in SoCal, both retired.","What to get my rich old-money grandparents (70F-74M) who don’t like me (21M) for Christmas.

513,family,My dad “forgave” someone who almost killed me and my mom.,"Before I start, I just want to say one thing; me and my dad aren’t on bad terms, but this is something I want other peoples opinions on. I just don't like the way he handled this.

So I live in a large city, and it’s not exactly the safest one, unfortunately. We’re particularly known for bad accidents in our area, and the amount of flowers on roadsides are WAY larger than it should be. (For those who don’t know, this means someone passed away there.) We’ve even had a few family members pass away from car accidents.

A Sunday afternoon, me and my mom were driving home from the mall, as we normally would after a day at the mall. It was on a main road, where thousands of people go per minute.

Suddenly, there was a huge crash in the back of my car, the car then spun in circles and started going in a whole other lane.

I was freaking out, I honestly didn’t know what to do, I just started screaming, then crying. (And I don't cry very often.) My mother, (the one driving,) was able to save us by stopping at a slightly safer area. We got out of the car to discover the entire lane was cut off. Two off duty firefighters who happen to be near came and helped us by calling 911. 

The person who smashed into us, was being careless. He wasn't even driving his own car, it was his brothers car. He had to give my mom his information. Police came, and
I messaged my dad ""CALL ME ASAP."" after he didn't reply to a few calls. When he called me back, he asked me why I was calling him and I had to explain what was going on. I gave him the location and told him to come and help us. He asked if we were alright and needed a ride back and I said I didn't know if we were alright as my back and shoulders felt horrible shortly after this happened.

Shortly after he arrived, I noticed he was telling the person who crashed into us carelessly these words exactly: ""don't worry about it, it's alright. These things happen""

Seriously?

This guy almost killed your wife and daughter, the only two people who life in your house, the two most important people to you, and that's what you say?

I wasn't in the best head space so I didn't tell him anything, we agreed my dad would take me home and I'd go get some rest while my mom deals with the car getting towed and everything else. (The car was gone. Totally broken. It wasn't in drivable condition at all after the accident)

When me and my dad went home, he asked me: ""did you notice what the first question I asked you on the phone?""

I told him it was why I asked him to call me, and he said ""after that""

I said he asked if we were alright.

He said ""see, I didn't ask if the car was okay I asked if you were okay""

Well I mean that's kind of a given, I really appreciate that he asked that I do, but it's bare necessities to ask about your family over your wife's car, no?

We eventually got a new car 2-3 days after dealing with our insurance companies reimbursements.
It was a older but next to unused car.

My dad said:
""We've been looking for a new car, so this all actually worked out really well!""

I didn't appreciate this statement too much. It all worked out well? Me and my mom almost dying worked out really well?

Tell me if I’m wrong but I feel like he didn't really handle this too well in some ways. He didn't seem to acknowledge that I’m terrified to drive or even be in a car now due to this near death experience due to a distracted/careless driver. 

Please give me your honest opinion, this situation really upsets me. I don’t feel it’s his place to forgive the person who crashed into us as he didn’t experience it.

516,family,my unintelligent mom putting all her money into bitcoin after watching youtube videos,"Before the crypto lovers come at me, I work in finance and understand it quite well, it's not about that but the reckless process of watching youtube videos of charlatans, taking them seriously and then deciding to actually follow through.

My mom has always had a very child-like mind, she is quick to anger (the kind of person to get mad at employees for no reason), and bad at ever reasoning things through. When I told her I thought the youtube videos were nonsense she got extremely upset at me for disrespecting her.

The reason it worries me is financial stability, my mom has never really worked a job, she divorced my dad and got his house almost 20 years ago, which she was able to sell for a couple million.

517,family,My mom puts her boyfriend before her kids.,"This isn't about me. Moreso the impact it's having on my younger siblings. My mom is typically nice and easy going, but if anything, and i mean anything, interrupts her special time. She has this boyfriend she's flat out obsessed with. She'll talk for hours at a time, every day and will flip out at the most minor inconvenience.

Apparently, kids are an inconvenience. He was over one day and my brother got really sick at school and she got furious about it. She said the world was against her and almost had a freakout about it. Because it interrupted her ""Herman Time"". (Herman is the fake name i'm using for the bf) He had a the flu and had to miss a week of school. I guess he was faking it.

My sister has some emotional problems, she's bipolar and has bouts of extreme anger where she curses people out and sometimes breaks things. I physically cannot do anything and moms the only one who could calm her when she gets in one of these moods. I can't do anything because i'm disabled and if she gets physically aggressive and makes me fall, i could end up hospitalized because of my bones. She refuses to listen when she's on the phone with Herman. She also bullies my little brother, he was crying and asking her for help and instead of putting the phone down to help him, she walks out of the house and leaves me alone with them. She didn't try to stop her, she left them alone and let sis have free reign to bully him mercilessly until she returned.

My sister hits my brother sometimes and mom genuinely won't care because it'll happen during ""Herman Time"".

It's literally impossible to do anything involving her. She chats with him all day, calls all evening and will often have him over literally all day and anything interrupting Herman Time is a war crime.

She doesn't believe in discipline, she mostly just threatens to take a toy away. Unless it interupts ""Herman Time"", then she actually takes action. She yelled more at my brother for hollering at her from another room then she did when he stole something at school.

She'll go out of her way to make time for him, but i had to beg her to help me go Christmas Shopping for the kids. She never went, she literally hasn't bought them the first thing for Christmas and it's the day before Christmas Eve. She keeps saying she'll get around to it, but never does. But Herman calls and says he's coming over the day before and a whole meal is bought and prepared for him ASAP.

I can't eat while he's here because she yells at me for interrupting her time with him while i go in the kitchen. She gets mad because i use the bathroom while he's here (I passed gas, it was kind of loud). She yelled because i made popcorn but burned it and the house smelled like burned popcorn

Anytime she has to actually do anything, she'll complain of a headache to get out of it, but apparently they always go away when Herman calls.

She got into the birth certificates and started tearing up important papers and she didn't care because it was her Herman Time. She can't stand for us to talk about him at all. Like he'll hang out for hours and then call as soon as he gets home to talk for another 2 hours. I simply said ""He called again? Didn't he just leave"". She yelled at me because i said he might've messed the car up (The car had a small problem with overheating, he looked at it and the next day, everything was messed up. The clock, gauges, radio, interior lights)

I try voicing these concerns but i always hear ""I'm allowed to have friends"" ""I have a boyfriend now, y'all just have to deal with it"" ""You're only acting up because i'm not spending all my time with you guys anymore""

I don't care she's seeing someone but some of the stuff she does is ridiculous. How could i explain it to her?","My mom puts her boyfriend before her kids. This isn't about me. Moreso the impact it's having on my younger siblings. My mom is typically nice and easy going, but if anything, and i mean anything, interrupts her special time. She has this boyfriend she's flat out obsessed with. She'll talk for hours at a time, every day and will flip out at the most minor inconvenience.

Apparently, kids are an inconvenience. He was over one day and my brother got really sick at school and she got furious about it. She said the world was against her and almost had a freakout about it. Because it interrupted her ""Herman Time"". (Herman is the fake name i'm using for the bf) He had a the flu and had to miss a week of school. I guess he was faking it.

My sister has some emotional problems, she's bipolar and has bouts of extreme anger where she curses people out and sometimes breaks things. I physically cannot do anything and moms the only one who could calm her when she gets in one of these moods. I can't do anything because i'm disabled and if she gets physically aggressive and makes me fall, i could end up hospitalized because of my bones. She refuses to listen when she's on the phone with Herman. She also bullies my little brother, he was crying and asking her for help and instead of putting the phone down to help him, she walks out of the house and leaves me alone with them. She didn't try to stop her, she left them alone and let sis have free reign to bully him mercilessly until she returned.

My sister hits my brother sometimes and mom genuinely won't care because it'll happen during ""Herman Time"".

519,family,Sister won't come home for Christmas,"My (28F) sister (25F) has been very vague about her plans to come home for Christmas and now it's apparent she won't come home at all. This is very hurtful to me because our brother died a few years ago and it's hard to see my parents disappointment that she won't be here for the holiday. Despite the physical distance, I try to be a supportive and good sister to her. This is not the first year she didn't come home for Christmas. She came home for thanksgiving for 24 hours with a random guy. I feel so hurt that I never want to talk to her again but I'm realizing that she might not care about me and my parents. Do I stop talking to her or keep letting her hurt me and my parents?

520,family,"Sister (19) ignores our dad, now I’m in the middle.","About 5 years ago, my sister just started ignoring our dad. No eye contact, never replies to his texts, emails. 3 word answers at max to any questions. She recently told just me that she may not like boys, and has known for awhile. This is the only fact I have to go off of to explain the resentment towards my dad. He’s pretty conservative, but we have gay/lesbian family friends ( literally two of his best friends in college were gay) and depite being conservative he is accepting regardless of sexual orientation. For years I have asked her to try to make eye contact, to reply, to do something!? 

Im caught in the middle becuase my dad once again has asked me what he’s done wrong, why she’s so cold. My dad is older and not in the best health. Im worried if something happens to him, she’ll be regretful. 

It just breaks my heart that my dad loves her, thinks she is HIGHLY intelligent (which she is!), and he’s so proud of her. And he just doesn’t receive any of this back. Yesterday he asked me if I can talk to her and see if there’s something he’s done or a reason. I said I can’t be in the middle, I don’t understand why she’s being like this. 

He asked my mom for some insight, and she just said maybe if you made an effort. Which pissed me off because if you’ve been ignored and treated like you don’t exist for 5 years…. What left is there to do. 

I guess my question is, is this normal? Do some teenage early adult girls just totally ignore their dads? If she has a legitimate reason, I’m happy to hear it. I just don’t think it’s fair to treat someone like this for so many years and never tell them the reason. If the reason is my dad watches Fox News and my sister is concerned he won’t accept her, why prematurely shut him off when she has no idea how he’s going to react. 

I just want to add, I love my sister dearly and we are extremely close. But this is causing some tension between us since I’m also extremely close with our dad and think the world of him. 

my mom years ago when this started told my sister you can’t just ignore people - it’s dehumanizing. My older sister had also tried. Now I’m the only one left to try and repair their relationship. My dad literally told me he loves when I come to visit becuase he gets to overhear my sisters conversations with me and learn about her.","Sister (19) ignores our dad, now I’m in the middle.

521,family,Should my step mother apologize?,"TW: SA

Okay so I was wondering should my step mom apologize after saying numerous horrible things to me? 
So I’ve been living on my own for a year now without seeing my dads side of the family for that whole year, now my dad and I are both kind of reaching out to each other but I refuse to go to any family events, visit him at his house, or see my stepmom. The reason being is my step mom abused me. For 7 years she non stop mentally tortured me and my dad who was FULLY aware of the whole thing turned a blind eye. 

Right after highschool I had just turned 19 and my step mother and my dad had kicked me out. The reasoning behind this was because my step mother had told me that my abuser should have (in better words) “done worse”. I won’t say what exactly she said as it’s THAT bad but to sum it up beat me till I died with certain things happening between that. She expected me to apologize to her for HER saying that to me. Doesn’t make sense? Exactly what I was thinking..... 
This wasn’t the only thing she said revolving my death. Multiple times she was tell me how I should kill myself or that she’d do it for me, she’d also text my stepsister (her daughter this). Mind you she’s been saying this to my step sister since I first moved in at 12 years old. And I have many screenshots to prove it. This isn’t just it though, she’s said so many cruel things to me during those years of growing up regarding my weight, school, friends (it eventually came to a point where she banned me from having friends) etc. The list goes on and on and on and my dad stood by her side through it all. The only time she got physical was a couple months before she kicked me out and before her fist could hit my face my older step brother caught her and got her to leave me alone. She was on one of her drunk tangents again and was mad that I had broken my leg a month prior. 

My dad is fully aware and thinks I’m being dramatic. Both even went as far as to make me apologize to my step mother for her saying my sa abuser should have done worse and killed me(to sum it up). I sent him all my proof and he still chooses to ignore it. 

I honestly believe she should apologize to me. Am I in the wrong for making my step mom apologize to me before I involve myself with them again?

524,family,Am I an asshole for wanting to cut my family out of my life?,"
My childhood was pretty tumultuous 
There was a lot of fighting yelling and parents argued a lot. 
While my dad has bi polar and poor emotional regulation he always came back around to apologize 
My mom was pretty avoidant and my older brother was incredibly manipulative he’s out of the picture now 
My little brother has his flaws now as an adult and granted I probably do too. 

Overall my family has the incessant need to be right all the time and digs the knife a little deeper when they are. 

I’m 26 now living on my own on the other side of the country. My parents are happily married and are really nice to me and my brother. In fact my grandma uncle and aunts are all really nice but due to the trauma growing up and the continuous need to be right all the time and the constant one upping each other, the holidays just aren’t fun. We all have the mindset of we can only spend max 5 hours together. We stick to ourselves there isn’t a lot of warmth and most conversations are pretty pensive and rather serious.

I wouldn’t say we’re a toxic family we’re just indifferent of one another. Its just not fun to be around them it’s more draining then anything. I love them, but honestly I put up with them. I don’t have a desire for them to get to know my friends or people I’m dating. 

Every now and then I think about what it would be like to cut them out of my life or at the very least just phase them out(though they won’t go willingly) 

I’m the only one who’s consistently sought out therapy I know they’re not perfect and I know others have it a lot worse. Am I stupid for wanting to cut them out?

Tldr: my family isn’t exactly a joy to be around. I had a pretty toxic childhood and while things are good now I wonder if I just have gotten use to it. I think about cutting them out from time to time and typically when I date, I don’t talk about my family. I’m pretty indifferent to them and I wonder if I’m the asshole for wanting to cut them off.. things don’t feel bad enough to cut them out but it’s not exactly roses to spend time with them.","Am I an asshole for wanting to cut my family out of my life?

529,family,Am I being to sensitive or am I using boundaries and being honest?,"Backstory: My parents had me when they were teenagers. They split when I was 2 and then I had step parents. I was raised in an environment that wasn’t great. My mom was very manipulative and did a lot of things that I’m still trying to figure out now. My dad was very stubborn and his relationship with my stepmom was full of fights. Basically I grew up internalizing everything and keeping stuff to myself because things were shaky and I didn’t feel like I belonged or was good enough. I was a people pleaser and tried not to make waves. It’s led me to my marriage of 18+ years which was very toxic/damaging mentally. We both come from the era of emotional neglect and shaming to guilt kids into doing things. 

Well fast forward and now we have 2 kids and I’m done with all of it. I’m tired of the gaslighting and the justifications of why doing something that is harmful is ok because it’s always done like that. I’m pushing back at my husband, my in-laws, and my own parents when I don’t agree with something. I’m tired of keeping it to myself. I don’t want my kids to ever feel the way I did and so I’m trying to stop using words or other things that could be misinterpreted and cause emotional/mental issues. 

So recently a comment was made about my youngest baby and how cubby she is. We all agree that we love the baby rolls. Well, then a comment was made to the baby that oh honey your mommy says that you have fat radish legs. I frowned and said that’s not what I meant. I was told that it wasn’t a negative thing and everyone back home uses things like that. I said I wouldn’t. I was then told that then people would say that I changed and don’t belong there. I said I don’t care. If they don’t like me the way I am because I don’t agree then f them. It went to the point where I was told that the person doesn’t like being told that what they are or do is wrong or that I’m telling them that they are saying something they weren’t saying. I told them that’s not what I’m saying, I’m saying it’s how it came across. 

I’m sensitive to stuff like that because I’m athletic with an athletic body but always had a bad body image because of “jokes” that people thought were funny but didn’t mean anything growing up. I don’t agree with jokes like that or imitating that I think my daughter has fat radish legs. I just love that she was able to gain weight. My first couldn’t and we had so much stress with her being so under weight. 

It accumulated to me having all these rules and that I get offended so easily. At what point do I let things go and what point do I enforce boundaries. I want my kids to have better than me, but I also don’t want to push back and they don’t have their large family growing up. If it were just me I wouldn’t care and everyone can pound sand. I’ve had to figure stuff out for myself my whole life and I’m just tired of all the BS.","Am I being to sensitive or am I using boundaries and being honest?

It went to the point where I was told that the person doesn’t like being told that what they are or do is wrong or that I’m telling them that they are saying something they weren’t saying. I told them that’s not what I’m saying, I’m saying it’s how it came across. 

I’m sensitive to stuff like that because I’m athletic with an athletic body but always had a bad body image because of “jokes” that people thought were funny but didn’t mean anything growing up. I don’t agree with jokes like that or imitating that I think my daughter has fat radish legs. I just love that she was able to gain weight. My first couldn’t and we had so much stress with her being so under weight. 

It accumulated to me having all these rules and that I get offended so easily. At what point do I let things go and what point do I enforce boundaries. I want my kids to have better than me, but I also don’t want to push back and they don’t have their large family growing up. If it were just me I wouldn’t care and everyone can pound sand. I’ve had to figure stuff out for myself my whole life and I’m just tired of all the BS."
530,family,Christmas Family Drama,"Not really sure what thread this should go in so I hope it’s ok here.

Me (31/F), my husband (31/M), and my daughter (1/F) planned to spend the week in between Christmas and New Year’s day with my extended family in Disney World.

My older brother called me and said his wife was exposed to positive cases at work (she’s a teacher and some students were positive). He said they didn’t plan on testing her unless she had symptoms and (to me) acted like if I wasn’t ok with that then I should no longer go on the trip. I called my mom (also going on the trip) for advice and she basically said the same thing. 

For the record, I knew there was a risk traveling to Disney, but wasn’t comfortable sharing a room with someone who may be positive.

A few hours later their son tested positive and so they tested his wife who was also positive. Needless to say the trip is cancelled, but now they want to reschedule for a time that works for them and is more difficult for us because of school break schedules. When I stated it was hard for us he basically said “Well then we may just have to consider not going all together.” 

I feel like they are continually putting the burden of being the squeaky wheel on me. I’d really like to go with my extended family, but I’m tired of being the one to always bend to what my older brother wants to do.

I know for a fact (through therapy) he manipulates situations to get what he wants. So I guess I’m just looking for feedback about if I’m overreacting for this specific situation? Idk I’m very frustrated with the way the entire day went.","Christmas Family Drama Not really sure what thread this should go in so I hope it’s ok here.

531,family,For those of you with your familys intact.,"Especially this time of the year, be grateful you have your loved ones still here. Tomorrows never guaranteed. Dont let small petty things get in the way. I lost my dad on December 23rd of 2016. It still hurts not having him here, I miss him so much. He was the leader of our pack and demonstrated to me what a should be and the extent that you may need to go sometimes for your family. My wife lost her cousin whom she was very close with as well the day after my dad passed. So to say this time of the year is rough for us is an understatement. We have a 13 month old little girl who is the best thing thats ever happened to us both and seeing her happy makes everything my dad did for me growing up make sense. I know youre not here with us physically dad but I know youre around. You'd love your granddaughter shes picking up things so fast and is already running around. Anyways, sorry for the rant everyone. But I have one ask if you are arguing about something small and petty with a loved one, let it go. Appreciate the time you have with them. Happy holidays.","For those of you with your familys intact.

534,family,Am I the asshole for trying to be safe?,"
Anyone else experiencing family drama over Covid? With Christmas coming up, me and my 3 siblings (who live hours from our hometown) have been trying to make sure our parents are being safe with Covid before coming to visit. 

My sister has a 6 month old baby so we are all trying to be as careful as possible. I have being laying low since last week and have been tested for Covid, as well as my siblings. Basically, my siblings and I have been making a tremendous effort to minimize risk of exposure (wearing our masks everywhere, forgoing risky activities such as gathering with friends, going out to eat, going to the gym etc.)We all agreed for Christmas that we would each need a negative Covid test (preferably a few spaced out) right before we get together. 

We recently come to find out my parents have been prancing around maskless (going to the bar, taking group workout classes at the gym, etc). They are apparently “not worried” about testing positive, however I am currently staying at their house through New Years (been here since Monday) and I am desperately trying to avoid being exposed so I can see my 6 month old niece who I haven’t seen since she was born. 

Before I made the trip to my parents, they had agreed they wouldn’t do any of these activities because I told them I wouldn’t want stay with them if they did. And now, my mom has proven that they are not holding true to their word. When I told my mom tonight I wasn’t comfortable with her going to the gym for a group class (knowing she very well wasn’t going to wear a mask) she justified it by saying “only a few people ever go” and said “if it would make me feel better she would wear a mask”. I actually would feel a little better if she wore a mask, but I told her I was having a hard time believing she actually would do that after she essentially lied and told me that she wouldn’t partake in risk activities this week just to get me to come stay over. 

Now my mom is upset with me for not trusting her and has totally turned this around on me, telling my sister I ~attacked~ her.  All I am trying to do is keep our family safe and Covid free for Christmas. The rapid test home kits are only so accurate and we have a baby to worry about. Plus, I didn’t even want to have to dictate or lecture them in the first place which is why I said I wouldn’t come stay with them if they wanted to take part in these kind of activities. I feel hurt that my parents can’t make a simple small sacrifice to not do stuff like this for ~2 days~ until Christmas in order to help everyone feel and be safe. 

It’s very awkward and tense here and my sister told me my mom expects an apology for calling her a “liar” which I never even did (I used the phrase “having a hard time trusting”). 

AITA for trying to keep this house Covid free so we can gather safety for Christmas ? Guess I should have just stayed home :(","Am I the asshole for trying to be safe?

535,family,Enough is Enough,"My mom found out I (F/32) got vaccinated and disowned me. I don’t really care whether you did or not this post isn’t about that.

My mom called me one day and made me promise I wouldn’t get vaccinated. I made the promise but I had already been vaccinated. I didn’t bring it up because I’m an adult and quite frankly it’s none of her business and I knew she would over react (as you’re about to see). She is extremely religious and every year the world is ending and Jesus is coming home. I am not religious. I like to say I’m spiritual. My mom and I have never had a great relationship. The past 3 years I have been working on our relationship so hard and we were finally getting somewhere. I put up with a lot from her, bit my tongue, pushed hurt feelings aside, forgave without apology, and made a genuine effort to be THE daughter. We were finally in a good place. I was calling her every other day, I flew her out to see me and meet her grandkids and my husband. I really opened my heart and home to her in hopes that we could finally be bonded as mother and daughter. But, after she found out I was vaccinated she stopped taking my calls and was more distant when she would answer. This went on for 3 weeks until I was finally able to muster up courage to confront her and tell her we need to talk. When I confronted her she told me that my lie was enough to ruin our relationship and she hung up on me. I was stunned she hung up on me because…..I’m an adult!!?! What?? The disrespect! She went on a smear campaign about me to close family and friends. Im heartbroken. I truly am. This happened a few days before thanksgiving and it ruined my Thanksgiving. I haven’t called her since. I don’t want to work for her love and beg her to love me after all the work I just did. I’m exhausted! I’m never enough. I even ordered her Christmas presents. They were delivered yesterday and she didn’t call or message to say thank you. I’m so hurt. All the work I did, all the effort I put forth, it will never be enough. Looking back now that I’m a mom I realize she put a lot of pressure on me as a child. I was never enough. No matter how hard I tried, one mistake would set her off. And she’d be off for weeks. As a child it would be so uncomfortable because I had no choice but to live like that. I was trying so hard to measure up so we could be “normal”. I have always wanted a normal relationship with my mom. I want to ask her for advice, talk about her childhood, our goals and dreams, I want her to have a good relationship with my kids, I want to go on vacation with her, I want to meet up with her for coffee, or go to the salon together. This isn’t a normal relationship and I’m finally coming to terms I’ll never get that. And it’s a lonely, heartbreaking situation. I just want a normal relationship like other people have with their mom. I just feel crappy, I just want a mom.","Enough is Enough My mom found out I (F/32) got vaccinated and disowned me.

EDIT: thank you to everyone for your considerate and well thought-out replies. You sound like great parents. My Dad just called me to apologise and said that we should make an effort to spend more quality time together. I think a lot of his initial response to the situation was him feeling defensive of me criticising him as a parent. I guess a part of growing older is realising your parents are people that also have triggers and immature responses sometimes. I’m still hurt, but I hope it’s something we can move past.","PARENTS: do you think a parent's dedication to their child ends when they turn 18?

- 

My parents were never married, and they broke up around 2015/16ish because they were constantly arguing and it started escalating physically. Police were called multiple times. There's no salvaging the relationship.

Despite this, my dad still really loves my mum. He does anything he can to be close to her. He often tells me he thinks they should start talking again. For context, my mum wants strictly no contact whatsoever, because she absolutely hates him and can't stand the sight of him. My mum is also mentally ill, she's not mentally in a position for any relationship really, let alone one with my dad. 

My dad is the only one who has a car, and my mum told us she doesn't want him parking his car near her house. Whenever I visit my dad, he always tries to park as close as possible, sometimes even driving right past the house. I always tell him not to, because I can absolutely understand where my mum is coming from. Whenever she sees him, it just brings back traumatic memories. She goes into an episode. Yet he still tries to do it. 

This year for Christmas, he has bought my mum a present even though she doesn't want it. He wants me and my sister to give to it to our mum for him. He did this last year as well. And the year before that. Every time, I tell him not to. He's still obsessed with her.

I can't take it anymore, it's too much. I'm dealing with severe depression already, and my (older) sister doesn't want to be involved. I'm only 16. I feel like I have no idea what to do anymore but it fucking hurts

540,family,My sibling continuously steals from me- what do I do?,"My younger sister (24) has been stealing from me (34) since 10 years ago. It started off small like stealing a hair product or makeup but then it moved onto more expensive items like pricey clothing and real jewelry. My other immediate family never believed me since she always played victim and knew how to manipulate them against me. But it’s true. When we lived together, I caught her stealing more than once. For instance, once I found my missing items stuffed in a corner at the top of her bedroom closet even after she claimed she didn’t have them. From fighting to real serious talks and pleading for her to stop, she never admitted the truth even after being caught red-handed. 

A few years have passed since my sister moved out and I really hoped she’d change her ways. She recently visited my parents and I for a few days and slept in my apt since I have an extra bedroom. My parents live downstairs and I go up and down, which gives her enough time alone. Today I found that a pair of my snow boots are missing from my closet after a thorough search, I’m left with an empty shoebox. I know the shoes were there because I organized that same closet a week or so prior to her arrival and sorted the shoeboxes. I’ve decided that I lost all trust in her from this point, but I don’t know how to proceed from here on. She could have also taken other things I have yet to discover. It boggles my mind because her husband is very well off, so she can buy anything her heart desires. 

I’m afraid she won’t stop and continue to do this. I don’t trust her in my apartment anymore. 


TLDR: My sister continues to steal my belongings even after I hoped she’d change over the years since she moved out - and I don’t feel 100% comfortable having her sleep over anymore. What should I do? I don’t want to ruin our relationship but I don’t want to be victim of her stealing addiction any longer. Thank you.","My sibling continuously steals from me- what do I do?

543,family,How do I (19F) deal with an emotionally abusive brother (21M),"None of my family backs me up because he’s not home often. My parents are pretty good at not showing favouritism but they will never stand up for me when my brother berates me and takes any opportunity to insult my personality. An example is this morning I was just chatting about how I wanted to celebrate Christmas like an American where they decorate elaborately and bake creative little treats because you don’t really have that in the UK and my family in particular isn’t really festive. He then took the opportunity to disagree and say that the only difference is that Americans have a lot of family round (not sure where this argument came from) and i said in this case I just wanted to decorate and bake and he got annoyed, told me I was argumentative and that I have no friends and struggle to make friends because of my terrible personality. This happens every single day and I’m called aggressive and argumentative for standing up for myself. He also explains simple things to me solely to remind me how stupid he thinks I am and then when I ask him not to he will manipulate the situation to seem as though he is being caring and I’m being aggressive. Sure, sometimes I misinterpret and cause arguments but it’s because I have to have all my walls up at all times because I’m so scared of what he might say to me. Sometimes he is physical too and he is a lot taller and stronger than me. Extended family prefers him and are closer with him so I just don’t know what to do or how to reach out to anyone I’m so distressed.

545,family,Horrible living situation,"Okay so this whole story starts with family long story short my dad passed away about a year ago and my mom has been pretty bitter ever since , she started talking to this guy let’s call him ,Jerry  

Jerry and my mom had been talking about 4 months after my dad passed away after a long hard battle with cancer that lasted a total of 4 years I was 12 when he got it and now I am 18 turning 19 soon 

I met a girl right after my dad passed around the same time my mom started talking to Jerry , we ended up meeting each other after talking online for around 4 months she then decided to visit me around 4 hours away 

It was love at first sight she is my everything, me my mother and my girlfriend were living together shortly after and all was well

Until my mom wanted to move down to Jerry’s house. And she did very-suddenly.  Jerry lived in the states And it was about a 12 hour drive and in a different country my mom was born in the states and so was I 

So at the time when my mom was planning on leaving within the hour she asked me if I wanted to come but my girlfriend wouldn’t be able to come due to her not having a passport 


So my options were

Go with my mom and break up with my girlfriend 
Stay at our original residence and try and support ourselves 

We picked option 2 and stayed in a small little town in Canada with no car and no money , we had a couple months rent paid and after that we would have to find a place of our own .keep in mind my mom left a whole house worth of stuff behind for us to deal with 

We both got jobs and eventually got our own place. We were both miserable for about 5 months in our own place with hardly any contact from my mother . It was really stressful but we kept on pushing on 

After about 5 months I think my mom really started to miss me so she came up for 1 day by herself and told me her and this guy I have never met are getting married and how awesome her life was down there telling us all these stories and fun things they have been doing for example 

Going to amusement parks 

Going out to eat every night 

Skiing a lot 

Bowling and more 

She went on and on and on .At this point me and my girlfriend were paying bills and doing great and we were really happy after a while our jobs got stable and fun and we had lots of friends and did a lot of fun stuff 

My mother got me and my girlfriend now been dating 9 months and very happy to move down there , from what we heard our opportunities were amazing and we could make it 

So we did , stupidly, we burned our bridges quit our jobs and fled , went down with all of our stuff in the back of and old pick up truck and drove 12 hours into a different country , we gave up everything we worked for amd left , we arrived and wow 

It was bad , really bad 

I could go on and on but in a nutshell 

Nothing was true ,none of the fun stuff or opportunities, there was no food in the kitchen we went from a whole apartment to a tiny room . My mom said there was homecooked meals everynight
Not true 

We eventually got to the point of breaking 
Both Jerry and my mom were being horrible to my girlfriend and trying to get rid of her using manipulation tactics that were brainwashing me and making me think my girlfriend was mean and bitter and then I reminded myself that my mom left me 12 hours away and it was my girlfriend who stuck with me and grinder with me 

We have plans to move back but with our savings emptied we are now stranded I am in serious need of help I will eventually explain more 

I know this writing is very choppy but if you have any ideas on how we could drive 24 hours from Idaho to Edmonton where my girlfriends family is … anything at all advice , knowledge. I am not asking for money

546,family,Is my sister sadistic? She said somethings and it made me feel uneasy but she was laughing.,"My sister (38 F) and me (30 M) we’re watching the Jake Paul fight with Tyron Woodley. There were some other fights before the main fight, there was a female fighter named Rachael Ostovish who the host said she got punched in the face by her husband when she was pregnant and my sister made a joke saying “Hey at least it’s better than getting punched in the stomach.” … couple months ago she randomly told me before I was born, my dad punched my moms stomach when I was in there.

When she said that I was automatically quiet and felt sick. Cold sweats and everything. 

Then when her boyfriend came in.. we decided to watch this show called 7 Deadly Sins on Showtime… it’s a pretty dark comedy documentary style show. She then brought up to her boyfriend that when I was a kid, she was telling me that my older brother (younger than my sister) was gay (which he isn’t.. she was making it up) etc.. when I was younger I didn’t know how to act and I cried… then she said she laughed at me and was still laughing. She still remembers it and gets a kick out of it.

It seems like she gets a kick out of inflicting emotional pain on me… I’m working from home now with my parents and she’s back too and I’m scared. Is she dark? Am I sensitive?

549,family,Any advices how to handle this kind of a sister,"First of all, I'm sorry if I would ask this here. I really don't know what to do so I just decided to write it down here. 

My sister is 22 years old and I'm just 14. Yet, she wanted me to act like her or become like her. I see her as a nice person when I was just around 3-11 years old but as I blew my 12th candle, I started understanding what she have been saying to me. Back then, I found everything funny but now I found out that getting jokes from her about my body just sucks. When I was 12 and I have to stay with my family because of the quarantine thingy, My mother noticed that I've been skipping meals, she didn't comfort me but she instead got mad. 
On the other day, my sister wanted me to go with them in the mall, but I can't choose my own outfit, If I did, She would judge it. 
She's nice on the eyes of others, While me? All I get was hate and talk shits. 
When my manipulative auntie and my sister were talking to eachother and I can clearly hear them, They talked about how pathetic I am that All I do in the day was to lie down and look at my cellphone. Well that's true, maybe because I was scared that they will have something to say again if I did something. Since everything I do is wrong to my sister's eye. I'm more scared of her more than my mother becayse my sister thinks that she is more smarter, She also sometimes get mad at our mother for being wrong on something. She is like controlling my damn life until now. It just keeps going and the more things she do to me gets stuck on my mind everynight and all I do was to cry about it secretly at night. If I fought back on a argument with her, I get called ""toxic"" by my sister in law and manipulative auntie. But now I'm 14 years old, everytime I hear her making jokes about my body,outfits, grades etc, I show no emotions. Even on my birthday, She made fun of my smile, She said that my smile were ugly. She's the only reason why I became insecure with my whole body and face. But I managed to survive...

550,family,Family issues (idrk how or what to title this if I’m being honest),"Throwaway for this - I’ve always wanted to make this posts but I keep just… typing and deleting it. And I don’t even know where to begin.

I guess I’ll start at the beginning. I’m an 18M, senior in high school. As a kid my parents did what some of my friends told me constitutes as emotional abuse. They’d say shit like “if you don’t get an A on this test I’ll leave you” or “I’ll kick you out of the house for __” or my favorite “maybe I need to get a heart attack and die for you to realize you need to do better” and stuff like that. Which, as a kid I didn’t know was guilt tripping at the time. So I was actually legitimately scared shitless. I had no clue what to do, and now looking back how they acted has definitely affected my relationships. I am now in constant worry of displeasing those closest to me and losing friends cuz that’s what my parents made me feel as a kid. That’s something I need to work on but… that’s just me getting started. My parents want me to go into a very specific career field. It’s one that I don’t want to go into and my dad said if i do he’ll just not talk with me… and if he doesn’t my mom probably won’t either. He did the same thing with my brother - he forced him into a career path he wasn’t too keen on and now he lives a sort of depressing life - it’s a problem with my extended family too. All of my cousins have suffered the same fate as my brother. So it’s kind of depressing to just see how things have panned out for them tbh. And as you can imagine that’s been a point of contention (the career stuff) with me and my dad, like a lot. And my mom and brother, even having gone through what he did, aren’t supportive of me either. Which has left me in a really weird place. I have come to realize that my family is just blood. I have no support system, cuz my family doesn’t support me and what I want to do. I have friends who are like family but… nothing can replace parents. And idk. I feel like I was robbed of something. I decided to make the post this morning cuz I broke down crying last night. My parents have never veen there for me through anything. I have always been emotionally distant from them and it’s fucking lonely ngl. Especially this time of year, when I see all of my friends happy with their families and then there’s me… who is emotionally estranged from his and who will probably not be talking with them in 6 months… it fucking kills me ngl. I just… idk. I’m a Christian, and if I’m being honest there are time where I struggle with my faith cuz I don’t understand why God would give me this family.

I guess I’ll start at the beginning. I’m an 18M, senior in high school. As a kid my parents did what some of my friends told me constitutes as emotional abuse. They’d say shit like “if you don’t get an A on this test I’ll leave you” or “I’ll kick you out of the house for __” or my favorite “maybe I need to get a heart attack and die for you to realize you need to do better” and stuff like that.

551,family,Advice on how to talk to my father,"TL;DR: I don't know how to talk to my dad. Even though I don't hate him, I have unresolved trauma that makes me lash out at him but I know I need to treat him better because it affects my whole family. Just need advice on how to get over it and treat him like a dad again.

I should provide some context because that description may paint me negatively. I (19F) currently live with my parents (49F and 57M) and my brother (18). From the beginning of my life, I was close to my dad, being the stereotypical daddy's girl and loving him more than my mum. But he cheated on my mum in 2017 and that was a terrible time for everyone. Arguments every day, my mum, brother and I had to stage interventions for my father who just refused to listen. That's when I realised that he wasn't perfect at all and I began to see him for who he really was– a person who was only good to the public and terrible to his family who always believed he was right. I fell into a deep depression and I tried to game-end twice but I never really told my dad. We just never got along afterwards and although I don't hate him anymore for what he did (mostly because he is my dad and I can't ignore him as he is the breadwinner), I just get anxious whenever he's around and can't help but lash out at him. I just never got help for dealing with my feelings towards him but I don't have the money to get it so I just try to stay silent and ignore him whenever I get like that until I can calmly talk to him. But he is stubborn despite me telling him about it and ignores it, asking why I have anxiety if I'm so brilliant and that game-ending isn't in the Bible.

Today, him and I had a huge argument that started with me being anxious all of a sudden and I didn't know why. But I told him to let me be alone for a bit so that I could finish up what I needed to do and then I would help him (although, it sounded bitter because of my anxiety). But then he kept barging into my room and I kept telling him that I was busy. Then we started to get hostile towards each other, which led to a huge argument that got very ugly fast. I told my dad that he never saw anyone's emotions but his own and I've been trying to tell him how I've been feeling but that how he acts towards me is why I don't tell him things. He just said that he was so good that he always tried to give me space and that he didn't know what he did and that this just proved that I'm not a good daughter to him because I was supposed to get over this. My mum and brother got involved, with my mum becoming a bit more ill and my brother calling me an asshole because he coped with the trauma whenever there was peace in the home. I feel so bad because I should be over him cheating on my mum years ago but I just can't. And I'm making it worse for everyone involved by stirring the pot, even if I don't mean to. I don't hate my father anymore but I can't find it in me to respect him as I once did. Any advice on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated.

Sidenote: Moving away is a no-go because he pays for my university. And my mum just doesn't want to get divorced because, again, money.","Advice on how to talk to my father TL;DR: I don't know how to talk to my dad.

553,family,I feel bad for not liking my father,"25M

My dad is really compulsive, loud, aggressive, manipulative and can often be obsessed. He always tells me what to do “as a recommendation” and tells me that what I do is wrong or basically always thinks he knows better.

He’s really toxic. We had a lot of fights over the years. Recently my ex and I broke up and I wanted to be left alone and he always kept bothering me and said insensitive things and took it lightly when it was a really hard time for me. That was the last straw for me and i’ve been avoiding him ever since.
My relationship with him over the years hasn’t been healthy. I don’t feel comfortable to share things with him since I was younger. He didn’t even know I had a girlfriend until someone told him. Since he and my mom got divorced seven years ago I came to his place like only three or four times. He sometimes can ask me if my brother is home because he saw that the lights are on in his room. Talking with him on the phone feels sometimes so intense, sometimes like a burden.

Today he reached out to me and texted me if I feel clean about deciding not being in touch with him. I told him that I don’t know but he just wants a simple yes or no, I know it’s an horrible thing to say but I feel pretty good. I just don’t know how to say it because i’m afraid he’ll do something reckless.
He lives alone since my parents got divorced and I know he feels bad not talking to me. 

Don’t get me wrong, he does all of it out of caring and loving but it’s just too much and it feels toxic. He gave me and my sibling everything but I don’t think he’s a good dad as a person. When I’m thinking about me being a dad I think about not being like him. I just don’t know what to do. Should I tell him I don’t wanna be in touch with him?","I feel bad for not liking my father 25M

554,family,How do I approach my mother about her behavior without hurting her feelings or damaging our relationship,"This is my first reddit post but I really just need to get this out anonymously and unbiased. Some background info first - I \[30F\] moved out of state with my now husband \[31M\] about 4 years ago, very far from where we both grew up. His family lives here, mine still live where we’re originally from. However, my parents recently bought a house here about 10 min from where I live now, and they’re planning to live here full time next year, along with my grandmother who I’m very close with. I was fine with it at first, but now my husband has raised concerns about our families interacting and specifically my mother. My dad is great, laid back, and easy to get along with. Everyone likes him. My mother can be a bit more challenging. She’s a know-it-all and has very strong opinions on basically everything. She also has this “IDGAF about what people think of me” attitude that is less than endearing, since it means she basically acts how she wants.

I love my mom I really do, and she’s been there for me in some very difficult times. Sometimes I think I’m almost blinded by the way she’s treated me that I can’t see the bigger picture of the way she really is, but I’m not sure if that’s the case or not. She also loves my husband and has supported him through some dark times as well. I know she means well and she’s not a “bad person”, but the thought of her interacting with anyone outside of the two of us has suddenly sent my anxiety through the roof. My husband has pointed out that I walk around on eggshells when she’s here, because I’m so nervous that she’s going to say or do something that just implodes everything. Other than our wedding, our families haven’t interacted all that much. My husband’s mother passed away years ago before we moved, so he’s very close with his father, and while I also get along with my FIL and he’s a nice guy, I don’t agree with most of his political and social views, nor does my mother. We haven’t had an “incident” yet, other than a slightly tense discussion on vaccinations when we all went out to dinner several months ago, but I’m constantly on edge that we will.

They’re here for Christmas, and they’ve invited me, my husband, and my FIL to their house for Christmas dinner. I’ve been sick with anxiety all week, and even though in the back of my mind I know that the possibility that something bad happens is low and it’s only a few hours I have to get through, that hasn’t helped me feel better. This can't be a thing every time we see them, since it's so damaging to my mental health.

My husband has repeatedly suggested that I need to have a conversation with my mother about just tempering the way she acts so that I don’t even have to worry about it. But to be honest, I’m not even sure who’s “side” I’m on, and I’m trying very hard to be objective. On the one hand I do understand where my husband is coming from because I DO know how she can be, but on the other hand I think he exaggerates a little when it comes to her behavior. I know that even just from reading situations here on reddit that it could be SO much worse, and I do try and tell myself that occasionally. I want to find a way to mitigate this before they live here full time, even just for my own sanity's sake.

I’m willing to have a conversation with her, but knowing her it has the potential to genuinely end in disaster, as she could just get overly defensive/offended, and I don’t want to sever our relationship or ruin the relationship she has with my husband and by extension his family. I just don’t know how to go about doing it or where to even start.

I just received my addmath result and I failed. I don't feel sad because I know i can do better and I am actually pretty confident that I will get a decent result for the subject. However my mother said i wont make it. She said im not going to pass the exam. I was mad when she phrased it that way. It made me feel hopeless and questioned my worth. My teachers and friends said that I am more than capable to pass the paper but why did she has to say such thing to me? Last time she was crying and told me that she was disappointed in my results. I think i did pretty well because I managed to get into the first class and I had the freedom to choose whatever course I wanted to take, obviously because my results were good enough. Maybe it was not the best, but I've never considered myself as an overachiever. At first it was guilt, I was feeling bad that I had to witness her, crying because of my results but on a second thought, I feel betrayed. The people who said I did well were my teachers, my friends and my grandma. My father once said he was ashamed to tell people about my results. I am actually a very sensitive person. I tend to hold my tears and cry alone in my room. I know they have done so much to me. I know they want the best for me. I know their words are not meant to hurt my feelings and I know they are not aware of my state of mind. I can understand it really well but I hope they can stop from doing so.

556,family,How Do I Maintain a Relationship with My Father,"For background info: I’ve recently found out that my father has cheated on my mother multiple times on and off in the past, and is possibly cheating on her right now. She knows, does not like it, but has chosen to live with the knowledge. She says it no longer bothers her and their relationship is beyond salvaging probably (they’re on the verge of divorce, which the cheating is actually a result and not the reason of). She says she’s happy living her life and doesn’t really care what he does anymore.

My problem is - I’ve completely lost respect for my father. My parents have always had a somewhat rocky relationship, but I tried not to take sides because I could see where both of them were coming from even if I didn’t agree. And also, I figured it was mostly between them and not my business.

However, learning that my father has constantly disrespected my mother this way to satisfy “his physical needs” as my mom puts it, sickens me. It’s something I would usually never tolerate in someone I want around me.

People might say “oh focus on whether he was a good father instead”. The problem is, my father would often complain about my mother to me. My mother wouldn’t do so regularly (unless they just had a really bad fight, in which case it’s just human nature tbh). In fact, my mother would sometimes even defend him if I badmouthed him. And his complaints were often what I would consider valid, even though I wish I didn’t have to listen to them and often told him so. But to know that he was making these complaints while he was out there disrespecting their marriage makes me see these complaints in a whole new awful light.

If we’re talking about how he was as a father outside his relationship with my mother, I’d say it’s… complicated. He was a better father to me than he was to my older sister. I think he tried the best he knew how, but that often didn’t match what he should have done. He was a bit absent in my early years because of his work situation. But he usually expressed his love, took care of us when we were sick, bought us what we needed, etc. He was short tempered and still is, and that commonly had him lashing out. I’d come to terms with who he is and how he parented us, mostly, and was able to maintain a fairly good relationship with him, taking it all into account. 

But with this new info, I don’t know how to reconcile the man who treats my mother so awfully with the man who would soothe me to sleep after a nightmare. Any advice except for “cheating isn’t that bad” is welcome.

557,family,[Older brother looking for advice] What do to with a stubborn 18 year old and 56 year old.,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post in, but I need advice for not only myself but for my sister and mother. I’m 33 and live on the East Coast, while my mother and sister live in the West Coast. I’m getting pulled into the middle of a dispute between my mother and sister and I don’t know what to do with either of them. 

My sister is a pretty typical kid, but now that she’s 18 she’s moved onto acting 28, as in she’s ready to move out and into her boyfriend’s(20 years old) apartment that is not yet set in stone and in another part of the state from where she and my mother live. Her plan is to move in together after they graduate high school, thing is she might not graduate and she isn’t accepting that as a reality. The dynamic of her relationship with the BF is not healthy. From what I’ve been told my sister financially supports the BF, even though they both have PT jobs. The BF’s family situation isn’t the greatest either, I believe they have been out of the country since before covid. Long story short, neither myself nor my Mother know how to reach her, to have her understand that she is heading down the wrong path. Part of me feels like she needs to learn on her own, but who really wants to see their family fail? She has no concern for her education, no concern for her future and only sees the 12 ft in front of her.

558,family,Step dad refusing to let me see my biological family without him,"My dad died from melanoma when I was 2 years old.  When I was 4 my mom remarried.  My step-dad has a daughter 4 months older than me, whose real mom turned her away from our family, resulting in us never being close.  We’re both in our twenty’s now, and the only time we see her is on Christmas and her birthday so she can collect gifts from my mom and step dad.  Back to my step dad.  He always told my mom he never wanted kids, not even his own daughter.  I was 4 when he remarried my mom, and he never tried to develop a relationship with me and never adopted or even wanted to adopt me as his own, despite me living in their house up until I went off to college.  I am still in this house when I am home for breaks.  So when I say he never wanted a relationship with me, it goes from not saying hi, good morning, or anything to me unless I say it first which has gone on for years, to wanting to address something with me and even if I’m in the room he’ll say it to my mom so my mom is the one to talk to me.  So with Christmas coming up, every year on the day after Christmas me, my mom, my step dad, and my step sister go to my biological fathers family Christmas.   Every year, my mom complains because my step sister wants nothing to do with us the rest of the year but is there on this day collecting gifts from my biological fathers family.  Finally, this year, I asked my mother if there was any possible way we could go to this get together without them, since it isn’t their family anyway.  Her argument is it is their family through marriage, however my dad died and my step dad didn’t marry my dad, so technically no, it is not their family.  This has resulted in my mom calling me evil, a failure of a daughter, selfish, and manipulative.  So I’m asking for opinions: am I being selfish for asking to celebrate the holidays with my biological fathers family without my step dad and step sister?  Side bar, none of the family at this gathering is even my moms family, it is solely my fathers family so the only relationship they have to any of them is through me and my mothers past marriage.  Please tell me what you think.

Also, when brought up to my step dad, he said to my mom, with me in the room, that if she (meaning me) doesn’t want us to go him and Carly (my step sister) will go by themselves.  None of them are their family.  My mom is also refusing to go unless we all go.  I said if they go, they can go by themselves and I’ll stay home and my step dad and step sister can celebrate Christmas with my biological fathers family if it’s so important to them.  Am I being ridiculous, or do I have a right to feel this way?","Step dad refusing to let me see my biological family without him My dad died from melanoma when I was 2 years old.

My wife and son go with me and stay with my mom some weekends, however the past 6 months every single time without fail the step-brother/step uncle shows up at my moms claiming to want to see my son. ( literally every single time) I am all for him being a part of the family if he wants, but he shows up unannounced and does not let my son spend anytime with his grandparents and is almost too excited about him.

I’m 15(F) my brother is 17(M). also my brother does come for my mother but specifically has something against me. i can never talk to anyone irl abt this bcos they say it’s simply just sibling rivalry but it’s not. the way he hits me, punches me calls me slurs. has no heart for me what so ever makes me hate my life. i don’t want to say this but sometimes i feel like if he was just to die my life would be so much better. i can’t even leave my room without him trying to come for me. i always have to hide my belongings when i leave the house incase he breaks them. his broken multiple of my ipads and phones and my mother never tells him off. i don’t know if she’s scared of him or she just isn’t bothered. but it gets rlly annoying sometimes bcos he gets no tell off for what he does and it’s so mentally draining when he does this. i’m only young and i’m so scared of my own household it never feels fun and i can’t do anything. also my cousins don’t like him and he barely has any turned  yet he always thinks anyone But him is the problem and that’s the worst part of it. i don’t rlly know why i’m coming on here but i feel like i needed to let this out and get any advice just to help me the tiniest bit. he also dropped out but just sits at home all day and is unemployed he is literally so lazy but now that he started going gym he comes and calls me lazy and says i don’t do anything w my life even tho i’m in chooky and it’s holidays rn so i can’t rlly do much bcos my mums at work.","my brothers hella abusive i come from a family that cares abt reputation literally more then anything. but i also have a rlly abusive brother. he punches walls, screams calls my mother and i slurs (my father is absent) he is the biggest narcissist and will always get things his way bcos my mum can’t be bothered with him fighting and screaming and ruining us. so the way she shuts him up is by doing what he asks. it’s really annoying bcos the last couple years his been like this my mother and i have distanced bcos she has always been looking after him.

563,family,My brothers stopped talking. What can I do?,"I have two younger brothers ages 19 and 24. They are my best friends and we’ve all lived at home with my mom throughout the pandemic. 

4 months ago there was a fist fight between my brothers which ended in them not speaking at all. 

My brother at 24 wants to make amends but the youngest at 19 has outright said he no longer wants a relationship with 24 because of all the fighting they did as kids. 

The three of us have always gotten on really well / very close so this state of affairs is heart breaking for me.

How do I cope with this new dynamic? 

Is there anything I can do to help (besides having talks with both which I’ve done many times to no success)? 

I’m assuming time will be the healer in this kind of situation but I’ve never been here before so any advice is welcome.","My brothers stopped talking. What can I do?

564,family,“Cousin” makes friends with guy who harassed me,"I have a cousin who is the same age as I am let’s call her Barbara. 

Being so close in age Barbara and I live together at her mothers house and we did a lot of things together we even met each other’s friends. I introduced Her to one of my friends Bob who I had known since middle school. We went hiking and grab pizza a few times. 

My friend Bob started to get really weird he showed up to our home with a Valentine’s Day gift and even a Christmas one and that is where I drew the line it just got weird because he romanticized all of my gestures all information that I shared with my cousin Barbara. 

Soon after Barbara’s mother passed away (my aunt) We had a fall out and this was a result of some things that Barbara had said and done. She tried to talk to me about it right after but I just wasn’t ready because of what was done and said I was very hurt. 

After not talking for some time I was very gentle in approaching her asking her if she had some time to chat. She agreed - I didn’t just want to send a load a text message to her after not talking to her for a while. 

I went as far as unfriending her because she would post things on social media that were unsettling for me. That is when I learned that despite my fall out with Bob he was attempting to be her friend after our fallout. My cousin had recently created a new artist account and it was new so I was able to tell he’s trying to friend her on ig. I even noticed how he sent her condolences soon after my aunt had passed away. 

If this was anybody else that I had introduced her to that wasn’t being creepy I think I would’ve felt a little bit differently about it. Why Bob feels the need to go as far as trying to have a relationship with my cousin Barbara it’s sickening and beyond me. 

So an attempt to cut all ties and connections I reached out to my cousin Barbara I told her that this man continue to harass me she didn’t reply to me for a few days. When she did I became livid and I don’t know if I was in the right to feel that way. She called me by my first name which she and the rest of the family no I do not like I go by a different name with my family so I instantly gnu OK this is not going to be a phone conversation I tried to see Past that. And she included in her text message that if she’s going to want me to have her unfriend Bob on her social media that she’s going to need a little bit more information because she got a different approach from him. 

Instantly I knew that he had reached out to her and I was pissed because I knew in my gut that this was his way of trying to be close to me and I thought sickening. 

I ended up talking to Barbara my cousin on the phone and long story short she basically told me that he did reach out to her and that she told him that no matter what me and Barbara have going on that if Bobby needed some type of CBD stuff for his mom that was ill that she would really go out of her way and help him. She came up with the excuse that because it’s his mom and her mom just recently passed away that it’s a little triggering for her. I called her out on it and I said to her well my mom your aunt is sick and she also has diabetes why don’t you worry about her instead of some random person I ended up hanging up on her kindly of course not abruptly but I was very hurt and very confused and I wasn’t sure if I was crazy for thinking that she should not have done that because we’re family.

565,family,Should I take back my cousins’ Christmas presents?,"Okay so I made a separate post about this whole issue but I’ll explain it real quick and add new details at the end. Basically my aunt and her boyfriend are separated, and the kids live with him to make things easier. Anyways her boyfriend and I got into an argument because he wanted to bring my Christmas presents over to his house to let them open it and I said no. I’d rather let them open the Christmas gifts in front of me, so I can see their reactions. Then he basically says I’m “ruining” their Christmas because I wont let them open my presents at his house. That no one would care what I got, if I didn’t let them take my presents to be opened at his house then I can take back my presents. Just today the 10 year old daughter told me their dad would let them open the presents I got them, but he wouldn’t allow them to bring it over to their house. So I’m guessing he’s still salty over this whole issue, and the daughter said he wouldn’t let them take the presents because I was “talking crap”, about this whole issue. He says I’m ruining their Christmas, when it’s really him. So now I’m wondering what to do with the presents I bought them, should I take them back like he said since he said he won’t allow them to take it home, or should I just let them open it. Basically it won’t even be in their possession since it would have to stay at a relatives house, and their dad rarely brings them over. But I don’t want to affect the kids, unlike him, but he’s being uncooperative.","Should I take back my cousins’ Christmas presents?

568,family,My mother expects me and my brother to give her money monthly,"So, this is it. My mother left the country  around 6-7 years ago, when she was 48, while I was 18 and my brother 28 and went to live to her native country. Now I am a 25 year, I'm working and doing a master's degree at the same time and living independently. I have lived independently since then because I couldn't live with my brother (it was very chaotic to live with him). 
However, since my mother left the country she didn't even work one day. It's been around 6-7 years she hasn't worked, she says it's because she has ""old parents she has to take care of"" but I feel it's a fat excuse. Sometimes, however, when I had enough financial resources I sent her money. Now, I'm doing my master's degree and I had to reduce my working hours, so I don't get as much money as before, while my brother is receiving a pension for disability. So, the other day talking to my mom, she said my brother was better because he was taking care of her financially (my brother basically wasted around 40,000 euros of my mom's money on a business that didn't succeed). It enraged me. I thought she was being absolutely unfair and putting all the responsibility for her needs on her daughter and son, when she is a healthy woman who could find a job, but was too lazy to do so. However, I also feel guilty somehow deep inside. I'm pretty much alone. My mother is like this, my father has a new family, and so I'm sustaining myself alone the best I can. What should I do in this situation?","My mother expects me and my brother to give her money monthly So, this is it.

It's been around 6-7 years she hasn't worked, she says it's because she has ""old parents she has to take care of"" but I feel it's a fat excuse. Sometimes, however, when I had enough financial resources I sent her money. Now, I'm doing my master's degree and I had to reduce my working hours, so I don't get as much money as before, while my brother is receiving a pension for disability. So, the other day talking to my mom, she said my brother was better because he was taking care of her financially (my brother basically wasted around 40,000 euros of my mom's money on a business that didn't succeed). It enraged me. I thought she was being absolutely unfair and putting all the responsibility for her needs on her daughter and son, when she is a healthy woman who could find a job, but was too lazy to do so. However, I also feel guilty somehow deep inside. I'm pretty much alone. My mother is like this, my father has a new family, and so I'm sustaining myself alone the best I can. What should I do in this situation?"
569,family,Aunt’s boyfriend being a jerk,"Okay so I made a separate post about this whole issue but I’ll explain it real quick and add new details at the end. Basically my aunt and her boyfriend are separated, and the kids live with him to make things easier. Anyways her boyfriend and I got into an argument because he wanted to bring my Christmas presents over to his house to let them open it and I said no. Then he basically says I’m “ruining” their Christmas because I wont let them open my presents at his house. That no one would care what I got, if I didn’t let them take my presents to be opened at his house that I can take back my presents. Just today the 10 year old daughter told me their dad would let them open the presents I got them, but he wouldn’t allow them to bring it over to their house. So I’m guessing he’s still salty over this whole issue, and the daughter said he wouldn’t let them take the presents because I was “talking crap”, about this whole issue. He says I’m ruining their Christmas, when it’s really him. So now I’m wondering what to do with the presents I bought them, should I take them back like he said since he said he won’t allow them to take it home, or should I just let them open it. But I don’t want to affect the kids, unlike him, but he’s being uncooperative.","Aunt’s boyfriend being a jerk Okay so I made a separate post about this whole issue but I’ll explain it real quick and add new details at the end.

But she constantly makes me feel guilty for it ""ok just leave me then! leave your mother to die then! :/""

I resent her because since i'm her only child and the family we have is in a third world country across the world, she needs people to take care of her (she can't drive so i have to take her grocery shopping, laundry, she can't walk far so she can't do basic things herself etc.) i hate that she relies on me and i can't just as a single woman with no kids move to wherever i want on a whim and just start a new life there without having to move her near me and taking care of her.

571,family,"My grandfather is sexually harassing my mother, his daughter-in-law","For some context, my grandfather (84) is from my father's side so my mother (48) isn't biologically related to him. My father passed away several years ago, and my grandmother (grandfather's wife) also passed away about 2 years ago. My mom and I have never really been close to my grandfather but since my dad's and grandma's passing we've tried to reach out more and provide more support since he's really struggling and grief-stricken on his own. My mom has this routine of dropping off this specific brand of bread to my grandpa's place whenever he's low on bread even though he goes grocery shopping with my uncle every Sunday and can easily get the bread himself. My mom has also been acting very visibly uncomfortable when my grandfather greets us all with hugs which I never understood. She just recently revealed to me that she's been acting uncomfortable because when she goes to drop off bread and asks my grandpa if he needs anything else, he has said multiple times that he ""does need something more but she never gives it to him"", and also makes a lot of comments about how young she looks, so she suspects he only wants her to drop off bread so he has the chance to see her alone. He also has winked at her after making these types of comments, and she said he's even slapped her butt before. He's never done or said anything sexual to me but after learning this it's changed my perception of my grandfather completely and I kind of want nothing to do with him anymore, or to at least confront him about it, because he has kept questioning me about why my mom acts so distant and uncomfortable around him. My mom won't go to visit him by herself anymore and will sometimes get me and my brother to drop off the bread. I don't really know what to do or believe since it's very hard to envision my grandfather in this way, especially since he's still in so much pain from losing my grandma, but my mom would never lie about something like this.

573,family,How to resolve disagreements with siblings? Today we had an argument about whether to drill holes in the house...,"My sister and I live by ourselves in our parent's house.

She has 2 cats where 1 bullies the other, so she built a wooden frame herself (while having no woodwork experience) with a fly-mesh in the middle, and wants to install it outside a bedroom, so the cats can look at each other and not fight.

She wants to drill holes in the door frame and in the wooden floor (it has a magnetic lock system), I advised against this saying it's not worth damaging the door frame and the floor for our amateur project, we could just hold up the mesh frame using 2 chairs on both sides. But she said this is an old house anyway, it doesn't matter if it devalues a bit, plus we can always paint over the holes if we uninstall this later.

This is only our argument today, but we've had other heated arguments about whether to replace wallpapers and whether to get cats in the first place. She's always the do-it-first fix it later type of person, I'm always the conservative, do minimal damage type of person.

Assuming that we're going to continue living together in the coming years, how should she and I communicate with each other to resolve our differences? ","How to resolve disagreements with siblings?

574,family,MIL moving in permanently. Any success stories?,"I’m writing this to get advice from others who had/have similar situations. I really don’t know what to expect. My husband (41M) and I (36F) are planning on moving his mother in with us indefinitely. It was always agreed she would come live with us one day after her retirement. She has been retired for several years now and as she is getting older her house is simply too big for her and her body is having a hard time keeping up with the work as well. My husband is her only son and while there are some cultural expectations, he has always felt a duty to make sure she is taken care of which I totally respect and understood before we got married.
 
Here is where I think I’m in over my head; She’s a bit of a tiger mom where she doesn’t 100% trust we know what’s best for us (even though we are almost middle age).  She constantly makes remarks of what we ought to be doing rather than what we are doing. This is across the board from house work to choices in careers. She doesn’t trust the way we run our house currently, she thinks we eat terribly and keep a messy house. This is not true and while I understand sometimes people just need to see things before they start to believe it, she has already stated once she moves in she will make sure to see we take better care of ourselves.
 
Its comments like these that I get anxious about the day she is moving in. I’m worried about losing my choice to be my own person. I won’t have the luxury of choosing my own meals, grocery shopping, sleeping in, or even how many hours I put into work. I also feel scared she is going to try to make this into an “us, vs. you” thing. In her eyes her son can do no wrong. I know this because before we got married she made sure to explain that to me. If we ever get into an argument I’m afraid I am going to get gained up on and essentially feel like the outsider.
 
I have spoken to my husband about this and he has agreed to have a conversation with her. He said he will reiterate that she needs to respect the way we manage the house and our schedules. But is that really all it takes to make this work? Is that too simple?
 
If there is anything I have learned about him is he absolutely respects and admires his mother and expects no less from me. I would not say he’s a “Mommy’s” boy but I think if I were to ever “bite back” on some of her comments then he would be quite upset with me. She doesn’t really have a filter and will make remarks about our appearance/weight. When I tell my husband how much it bothers me that she says stuff like that he says I need to have thicker skin, I’m too sensitive and that he doesn’t see this as a problem.
 
We are planning  on having a conversation with her tomorrow on the exact move in date (early next year) but some helpful advice and success stories would be so nice to hear. I know a positive outlook on this is key and it’s something I’m working on. Please tell me this can be managed.

575,family,How should I (19F) react when my partner’s (20M) 5 y/o brother throws a tantrum?,"My partner and I have been dating for 9 months and because of the stage of life we’re at now, we spend most of our weekends at his house with his family.

However, I’ve noticed since the beginning that his brother gets very little attention at home and gets spoiled with new toys to make up for it. As much as I love and care for his brother, it’s hard for me to be there for him and teach him when I only see him once a week. I know it isn’t my responsibility to parent him, but it pains me to watch a good kid act so violent just to get a second of someone’s attention. I try my best to gentle parent whenever I can because I fear traumatising him if I react wrongly.

For example, I noticed he’s had an issue with sharing that his parents clearly do not care to properly address. They usually give us a portion of whatever he’s refused to share when he isn’t looking, and as a result he learns nothing because he wasn’t even aware he’s been deceived.

In the most recent case, we ate some snacks that were bought for sharing, and when he found out he threw a tantrum and demanded we slice open our stomachs and return the snacks to him. I was a little taken aback, and tried to explain that he had to learn to share things that didn’t belong to him, and that he has a family who loves him and shares things with him all the time. He refused to listen and got angry at me, demanding me to promise never to eat snacks again. I refused to make a promise I couldn’t keep, so I let him self-regulate until he’s calmed down.

I’ve been trying a gentle parenting approach whenever possible since all his parents do is laugh his bad behaviour off or threaten him with unrelated consequences. May I have some advice on what to do or say?

He doesn’t do anything else but we don’t even talk and yet he goes all the way upstairs to my room or to the other side of the house just to do this. Usually, he stays in his favourite room where all the windows are covered, listening to church sermons, watching paranormal activity, investigating aliens. Most of the time I can hear his whispers as he prays for hours and hours (open concept house, thin walls). He is followed by a psychologist and medicated. Probably needs a psychiatrist too.

I am so sad because he wasn’t like this but I’ve run out of patience. I’m tired of being the one to reach out. I’m done. Most of all, I am so uncomfortable in my own home and can’t sleep properly. It’s annoying, frustrating, I can’t anymore and it happened again. I’m stressed and understaffed at work, when I get home, I deal with this.

580,family,Reaching Out To My Absent Father?,"Hello Reddit! This is my first time posting here, but I'd like to ask for some advice and I don't know if there's any better subreddits for this.   


I'm 17, soon to be 18, and I've never known my biological father. I had tried in the past through Facebook before I had reached out to my step siblings, and never gotten a response.  I met my step-siblings on his side a few years back, one time in person. They're much older than me (both have kids) and I only keep in contact with my Step-Sister using snapchat, but we don't talk much. When we had talked, they both mentioned that they were glad they got to meet me first, as they weren't sure about how my Bio-dad would react, and assumed it would be negative. Recently I had been considering reaching out to my bio-dad. I reached out to my step sister again in order to express this, and she suggested either calling him directly, or writing him a letter since he didn't use Facebook and most likely just didn't see it. I felt like calling him right away and explaining that he had a kid would be shocking, so I said I would mail him, and she provided me his address.   


Once I had it, I had to really start to think about what I even wanted to *say.* I wasn't sure on how I was going to word things, or what I wanted to ask of him. It became a problem when I suddenly received a message. On Facebook. From the man himself. My stepsister had called him and let him know that I had asked her about him. He apologized for not responding and said he didn't use facebook, which I knew, and explained he would love to meet me. I didn't know really how to feel about this, but said I'd love to meet or get to know him at least. He offered to come pick me up and take me to go see his family for Christmas- an idea which scared me immensely because I didn't want him to know my address or spend a few hours of a car ride with someone I didn't really know- so I got back to him the next day and said that I'd be busy with my family, but that I'd love to get to know him over text until I could find a different and better time to meet in person. He hasn't responded, but it says he saw it.  


I feel really bad for avoiding going to meet him- but I don't know this person and I have too much anxiety to just make myself do it anyway. What am I supposed to say to him? What do I ask about this person that I don't know, someone who should've been a part of my life from the start? I don't hold resentment, none that I know of anyway, and I know my mom's part of the story about why he wasn't there in the beginning.  How do I get to know him? I only wanted to reach out in the first place to know the medical history on his side because it's important to me, but it feels kinda shitty to just ask that and leave again, and I would like to know him- I just don't know how.

582,family,"Our children attend a private Christian School, but my middle daughter has stopped believing in God","Bit if back story, hubby (53m) and I(38f) have 3 children together (13f, 11f &amp; 9f), I am hubby's 2nd marriage (he also has a daughter (32) from his first marriage, but she isn't involved in this question/query)

We live in a low socio-economic area, which has a Catholic school, our Christian School and public school, so if we move away from the Christian School, it means sending our children to public school, which I don't really want to do

We transferred my eldest to the local Christian School when she was in prep, as the local public school thought it was fair for the students to have 3 grades in 1 class (prep, grade 1 and grade 2), and we found that her (as yet undiagnosed) learning disabilities were being ignored (I had an older brother with learning disabilities who was 18 months older than me, and I know what he and my parents went through), when miss 13 was 9, she started having seizures which led to her being diagnosed with Hydrotopia 

When miss 11 was 4, she was diagnosed with Selective Mutism and social anxiety

Anyway, skip to now, Miss 13 is now in High school (going into year 8 in February, not yet caught up with the rest of her classmates), miss 11 is going into year 6 and miss 9 is going into year 4)

Hubby is an athiest (sp?), I am a Christian that doesn't attend church

So during the summer school holidays (in Australia) miss 11 has come out and said that she doesn't believe in God, which has led me to being worried as to what to do about her education, she was set to go onto the same (Christian) high school as Miss 13, but now I am not sure, we were already worried about her social anxiety showing up when she started high school, but if we put her in the local high school, it is going to be even worse for her anxiety 

There is no chance of us moving, and even if we did, most of the private schools in Tasmania (where we live) are religious schools, I think in southern Tasmania we have about 3 private schools that aren't religious which are all situated in and around the capital city, which we live 20-30 minutes away from, if we go public school, she has to attend the nearest school (which our local school has a Really bad reputation, (assaults, bashings, 1 person was murdered there, the high school has been burnt down 3 times) we really don't want to send her there

When we (mother and I) politely ask her to quiet down because we can't rest at home in this very tiny flat, she tells us to shut up and quit crying about it. If we are more agressive then she attacks us by punching, kicking or biting my mother and spitting on me. She is so obsessed with gaming. My mother refuses to get help from outer authorities, like psychologists or psychiatrists to end her addiction.

And because she is up until midnight or later and my mother goes to sleep usually at 9PM or 10PM, she has to get out of bed every 15-20 minutes and have a loud quarrel with my sister, then she tries to sleep back but she can't so she get up from bed after 15-20 minutes and quarreling, and then the cycle repeats until my sister stops gaming around midnight or 1 AM.

My sister is in charge at home, my mother (and even my fther who left us 3 years ago) lost control over her like 6 years now. We are at the point that if we call any authority to help us, most likely they will take my sister out of the family and she goes to the orphanage since not a single authority tolerate that my sister beats up my mother for every little conflict.  So we need to solve problems step by step completely ""homemade"" even tho it seems impossible.

585,family,how can i help my 13 yr old brother with anger issues?,"to put in simple terms, my brother is an asshole, i love him a lot and he is probably the person i am the closest to in life but he is has really bad anger issues, is very self centered, and cannot for the life of him back down from a fight (physical or verbal) even if it hurts the people around him.

he has an extremely short temper and will get mad over anything that doesnt go his way. just today he got mad because he left the house to go out with his friends (which he does often) and didnt clean the kitchen, so when my mom came back from work and blew up at him because of it he immediately tried pinning it on me and saying that i didnt finish the dishes yesterday even though i did and told me to go clean the kitchen, he was also yelling at my mom and getting very angry with her, this happens almost daily and its becoming really tiring. ive tried talking to him privately and telling him not to blow up when he gets angry and instead try walking away but it doesnt help that my mom is also pretty short tempered.

i honestly have no idea what to do anymore and am really just at a standstill. i dont want to say something that will give him self esteem issues or fuck him up mentally but i have no idea how to do it. i dont want to be scared of my own brother but its hard when he gets so angry all the time.

also i dont know if this will help people understand better but our parents are also divorced and me and my brother have gone through pretty bad verbal and psychological abuse from my dad. my dad used to target my brother a lot and i have no doubt he has trauma from that but its been about 8 months since my dad left the house.

in conclusion does anybody know how i can help him?

586,family,My Parents Divorce Almost Killed Me,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post on this platform, and this urge to share my story comes from lots of personal reflection and wondering if anyone out there can relate to my story. Quite honestly I also hope future parents out there read the story and can try and avoid what my parents did to me.

My first memory is my parents telling me they're getting a divorce when I was around age 6, for a few years nothing really affected me, up until about age 9 when my parents I guess both agreed it was time for me to take more responsibility for the family issues. From about 9-12 years old my mom fed me a steady stream of information that my dad was a deadbeat who didn't pay any child support, which is why I would go to school with holes in my shoes, and clothes from goodwill on my back.

My dad was well off, and very much considered upper-middle class. When I wanted something from my dad, I usually could have it (within reason like maybe a new skateboard or snowboard), so naturally, when I would show up to his place on the weekends with distressed clothes and busted shoes, he would get extremely angry with me that my mom was not using his child support to provide us with the necessities we needed.

Year over year my father grew even more tired of the wasted child support, which at the time according to his records, he was paying my mom about 50k a year. I spent most of my high school years in a depression, wanting to kill myself pretty often as my parents put more and more pressure on me to bring justice to the family. My mom wanted me to confront my dad about ""not paying"" child support, and dad wanted me to confront my mom about her spending the child support irresponsibly. I still vividly remember my dad sitting me down and telling me that if I don't confront her and fix the issues, he'll have to take her to court and I'll likely have to testify against her.

Senior year of high school rolls around and things are getting really really bad, my dad is officially taking my mom to court, and he told me he needed me there to testify against her to a judge. He also told me that if I confront her, it may stop him from going to court and save the family. To help me summon the courage my dad sat me down at the kitchen table with a stack of files, I didn't know what to expect from the files but my dad was adamant about showing me what's inside of them. He was mostly motivated because I had confronted her in the past as per the instructions of my dad, and my mom would say he's lying, then I'd relay the message to my dad and he would say she's lying, then over and over again for years.

Inside this folder my dad showed me:

* Photos of my mom's car with posters taped to the windows saying ""good parents pay child support"" (my dad would get calls about this and lose clients)
* Emails about her cheating on my dad
* Proof of his child support payments
* a lot more that I can't remember because I believe my brain turned off after the first 45 minutes of the show and tell

After many deliberations, nights sleeping in my car, crying myself to sleep, and almost taking a knife to my stomach, I summoned the courage to confront my mom about the allegations. This was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life and I still have the mental scars from it. I had to look my mom in the eyes and tell her she's been lying to me for most of my life. This broke out into a pretty big fight between my mom and I and then she started pulling bank statements showing just how poor she is and how my dad is coming after her like a bully, something I just can't fucking forget.

The day came and I didn't show up in court, I just couldn't do it. I realized at that time, the greatest thing I could do for the family was to let the two parties settle this themselves. I knew that if I had shown up that day, it would have killed my relationship with both my parents and I was not going to be the sole reason the family stopped talking.

My dad won the case without me and my mom was supposed to now begin to pay back the money, I remember the sigh of relief I had that day when I got the text, it was like I was free. After that I went to my mom and did something I had never done before. I stood in front of her, got on my knees, started crying, and mumbled ""I'm broken"". I was worried about my mental health and believed that the trauma I had suffered would likely lead to my death so I asked her about therapy which luckily her insurance covers.

That was not the last of the issues between them that I've had to get involved in, but I'm old enough now to not give a fuck what those two do so that's good. I'm 22 as I'm writing this and spent over a decade trying to be the glue that keeps the family together, I'm mentally scarred for life and still have vivid relapses from the hardest times. Unfortunately for me, this doesn't even scratch the surface of the amount of suffering I was put through but I wanted to try and keep this as short as possible.
I also have a sister and twin brother, but to protect my brother I would often leave him out of the family stuff because I don't think it’s right for both of us to suffer when only one of us had to. My sister and my dad didn't talk for about 10 years (she was 15 when it first started) because my mom turned her against him with the lies.

Today, my sister now has a great relationship with my dad, and my relationship with my parents has never been better. I still need to go to therapy regularly but highly advocate for it to my friends which I recently started doing to encourage other men to seek the help they not only need but deserve.

On some level, I'll unfortunately always have a small spot in me that hates my parents for what they did to me, and neither of them knows how close I was to killing myself, and quite honestly I'm pretty surprised I even survived this ordeal, but I guess I'll take that one to the grave because I don't think it would help anything for them to know. If they were having a kid then yeah I'd sit them down to give them a lesson on how not to raise a child, but at least I'll have the knowledge myself for when I start raising a family of my own.

I hope someone out there can find some sort of use from my story, and I'm also curious to know if there are other similar stories out there about parents dragging the kids into the divorce. Either way, its 2021, stoping bringing your fucking kids into the divorce. Rant over.","My Parents Divorce Almost Killed Me Hi Reddit, this is my first post on this platform, and this urge to share my story comes from lots of personal reflection and wondering if anyone out there can relate to my story. Quite honestly I also hope future parents out there read the story and can try and avoid what my parents did to me.

My first memory is my parents telling me they're getting a divorce when I was around age 6, for a few years nothing really affected me, up until about age 9 when my parents I guess both agreed it was time for me to take more responsibility for the family issues. From about 9-12 years old my mom fed me a steady stream of information that my dad was a deadbeat who didn't pay any child support, which is why I would go to school with holes in my shoes, and clothes from goodwill on my back.

My dad was well off, and very much considered upper-middle class.

587,family,Verbally Abusive Family,"Background Info: I am a 26 (F) and my partner is a 30 (M). About 2 years ago we moved into my parents house to save for a deposit. We both work full time and I have been saving for 5+ years for a house but we live in an expensive city and can’t get into the market. We ended up buying a motorhome because we decided we don’t want to live in this city (We both find it stressful here in the rat race. I have lived overseas and know what else is out there) and want to explore smaller towns to use our deposit. We have been working on the weekends to build our motorhome and saving every penny to get out. My mother and older sister in particular have always been aggressive and verbally abusive. My dad enables and puts up with my mums behaviour and my little sister keeps to herself. From a young age I have avoided them and dreaded when they will be home. I am aware that I am too old to be home and that my own choices have got me in the living situation I am in. I am very grateful at the opportunity financially but don’t believe I have deserved to be treated the way I have. I am planning on moving out in about two months.


I have recently come out of a really unhealthy work situation. I was performing really well at my job but was extremely burnt out. My whole team has left bar one toxic person (the manager) in the last two years. In the time I was there I completely transformed my department and built it from the ground up. (I was the only person in my specific department) My bosses up the chain were very happy with me. Despite this my immediate manager would yell, threaten and berate me constantly. I stayed in the job for as long as I did to achieve the goals my partner and I have been working on but it has taken a toll on my mental health. I have now finished and I am so excited to heal and get back to myself. My partner finishes in a week and we will be working on our motorhome build together in the drive way every day until we can leave, travel and relocate to a smaller town.

Now that I have finished my job (my partner still has 1-2 weeks left) I am home a lot more. My older sister works from home out of the living room. As I have been burnt out for a long time I’m trying to heal. All I can hear the whole time I’m home is her arguing with her colleagues and working. My mother and sister both explode easily so I have been tip toeing around and trying not to disturb her. Every time I walk into the kitchen to grab something before I leave she corners me to complain about her work and tell me long winded stories. When my mother gets home in the afternoon she immediately starts yelling about everything around her that dissatisfies her. She complains a lot about the house dad renovated for her but it is honestly such a great home that my partner and I could never afford. She turns the TV on really loud yells and complains at my dad until he goes outside to work on the house and then sits on the lounge with her snacks and calls her friends to talk loudly on the phone. There is no peace and quiet ever and no one respects boundaries. I am trying to improve on my mental health, get back to the gym and eat healthy but I can’t catch a break from anyone.

The main issue: I have asked my sister a couple of times politely to not talk to me about her work problems during the day when I am doing things and concentrating. I have explained that I’m sorry she is going through this crappy situation but I am really struggling myself stress wise after coming out of a toxic work situation and that I finally have a chance to have some down time and be positive and that the middle of the day is the only alone time I get. She has continued to ignore and vent to me everyday. Yesterday, I got home from the gym in a happy state. She immediately cornered me to tell me a work story. I said hey I appreciate you want to tell me your story but I’m taking a break from work. She ignored it and continued with her story. I reiterated. She then started raising her voice and telling me I’m selfish, everyone in the house hates me and that if she was suicidal it would be my fault if she dies because I don’t want to listen to her. She continued yelling for about 15-20 minutes. I was trying some new techniques like counting in my head, staying silent to see if she would stop, asking her to please walk away, turning my back to focus on my cooking. She continued to yell. When she stopped I avoided her for the rest of the day. Later in the afternoon my mother got home and was yelling about covid to my sister. My sister said to her that she doesn’t want to talk to her about it because she is on another level with her understanding and it frustrated her. (This was respected) Then they started yelling about the batteries in the remote because my sister took them out to use for her work mouse and my mum wanted to watch tv. I stayed silent because I don’t want to be in the drama. My sister again started yelling at me and brought me into it. She was saying some nasty things like everyone in the family dislikes me etc. It immediately turned on me and she was saying that I’m not allowed to say I’m having a bad day at that I should be available to her whenever she needs because that is what a good sister would do and that is what she would do. She also said things like I need to grow balls and suck it up. I stayed calm at first but then I started to cry because the things she was yelling really hurt. She started saying that I just cry because I like to play the victim. I said that I would never be offended if I was venting about my work and she told me she needs alone time because she herself was struggling. This example is basically a cycle it happens with every boundary I try to set with my mother and sister and even if I kissed their feet and begged for forgiveness I can’t escape their unleashing of verbal abuse.

Question: I don’t know what to do. I really need some time to de  stress but my verbally abusive family refuse to respect my privacy and boundaries. I have tried respectfully communicating my reasons for my boundaries but they explode, berate and yell at me when I stick to them. Is it wrong what I’m doing?

588,family,"My sister wants my wife and I to come visit more often, but my wife doesn’t like my sister’s personality/values. How do I have that conversation with my sister?","My sister (let’s call her Susan) really wants my wife and I to come visit her more often. But the problem is that my wife isn’t too fond of my sister Susan. Here’s just a few things my wife doesn’t like about her:

* Susan can be homophobic at times (my wife and I are a straight couple, but we feel strongly about LGBTQ acceptance).  
* Susan is emotionally needy - she needs a lot of attention for her to feel satisfied in her relationships.  
* Susan has a cynical, egotistical personality - she thinks everyone is a hater and always out to get her.  

Despite all this, my sister is always nice and cordial with us. She doesn’t treat me and my wife bad or anything, but my wife is just the polar opposite of my sister and she doesn’t like a lot of my sister’s personality traits — which makes her not want to visit as often.

How do I have this conversation with my sister? Obviously, telling her “my wife doesn’t like you” will probably only make things worse.

590,family,Moving in with my bf,"I (F21) moved in with my bf (M25) many months ago but my family didn't know about it since they think I'm living with my roommate in another apartment. So imma have to tell my parents about it one way or another. Half of my stuff is in our apartment and I still need to take the rest of them and talk to my old roommate about my leaving. That would ease the situation up because my roommate's mom is colleague at work with my mom, and my rm has got a different relationship with her relatives because she tells them EVERYTHING. I could never tell her something without wondering if she's going to spill the tea to her mom and after that, her mom to mine. So my mom was using my roommate as a tool for controlling me. Regarding to the moving out part, I am not seeking their approval nor their blessing because I am an adult. I just want them to support my decision and help me nonetheless. They are narcissists and would try to gaslight me a lot and maybe try to tell me to go back home because of COVID. I don't know how to address this without them, especially my mom, making a big deal out of it. I just want to be happy and understood. But they will never try to understand that. My mom was against my bf too because he's from a different part of this country and she doesn't like their culture and behavior. I swear, nobody else treated me this better than him. He's the sweetest human being. But my mom still wished me to get involved in a car accident the first time I go see my boyfriend's relatives.

592,family,My dad tries to make me feel bad for not wanting to be a super aunt to my nieces and nephew. Am I crazy for feeling like this?,"Hello everyone, I have three nieces and two nephews. One of my nephews died in 2018 from cancer. I have to say, that I absolutely love all my nieces and nephews. But, my dad expects me to be some kind of mother figure to them. Let’s start from the beginning. My mother died when I was 11 years old from breast cancer and my dad raised me and my two older brothers. My parents where married when my mom died. My oldest brother have three daughters and my middle brother have two sons, his oldest son was the one that died from cancer. I’m 24 years old and I’m trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I just graduated from university this past May, I got a job a month and a half after graduating, I did that for about five months, and now I’m doing an internship for a law firm. I’m trying to move out of state in February to March. As much as I love my dad and brothers, ever since my mom died 12 years ago, they caused me a lot of pain. 

My mother loved children and I feel like my dad expects me to be like her. I think children are a blessing and deserve wonderful homes, but I’m not interested in having children of my own any time soon or raising someone else’s. I’m tired of being taken advantage of. My oldest brother doesn’t reach out until he needs me or my dad to watch his youngest kids. My dad volunteers to watch them and then he just pawns them off to me. Every time my nieces come over, I cook for them, clean after them, and take care of them. And my dad just goes on about his day doing whatever he wants, while I stay at home with them. Whenever I don’t feel like dealing with my nieces, he tries to make me feel bad about it. He reminds me that they are my nieces and I need to be there for them. My oldest brother just got a divorce for the third time. He went on and on about how I can relate to my nieces because their kids and their parents are no longer together. I told my dad, my mom dying and my niece’s parents no longer being together are two completely different things. They have their mother and father. 

My oldest niece have a lot of mental health issues. She’s 15. She tried to kill herself in March and she was sent to a mental hospital. I love my oldest niece to death, but she’s exhausting to deal with. She throws a fit whenever she doesn’t get her way, she will bombard you until she gets what she wants, she wants everyone to feel bad for her, and she’s a serial liar. I love her to death, but I don’t have the energy to deal with her. She came to stay with us July 2021 and the whole time she was here, I was miserable. My dad kept telling me that I needed to support her, show her that I love her, and I needed to be a better aunt. I was frustrated because he was taking his frustrations out on the wrong people. It’s my oldest niece’s mom and my oldest brother’s responsibility to make sure she’s getting the help and support she needs. I just started my new job then, and it was my very first job. I was new to the workforce, trying to learn my new job, and my dad expects me to focus on being a super aunt.

I’m a 24 year old virgin woman. I made the decision not to have sex until I am married. I don’t want to chance any possibility of me having a child right now because I know that I would be a horrible mother. I’m not willing to sacrifice everything I need or want to do. I also have PCOS, so I might have a hard time having kids in the future. I want to move out of state, start my career, and start living for myself. Ever since my mom died, my whole life has been dealing with my exhausting family. Am I crazy for feeling like this?","My dad tries to make me feel bad for not wanting to be a super aunt to my nieces and nephew. Am I crazy for feeling like this? Hello everyone, I have three nieces and two nephews. One of my nephews died in 2018 from cancer. I have to say, that I absolutely love all my nieces and nephews. But, my dad expects me to be some kind of mother figure to them. Let’s start from the beginning. My mother died when I was 11 years old from breast cancer and my dad raised me and my two older brothers. My parents where married when my mom died. My oldest brother have three daughters and my middle brother have two sons, his oldest son was the one that died from cancer. I’m 24 years old and I’m trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I just graduated from university this past May, I got a job a month and a half after graduating, I did that for about five months, and now I’m doing an internship for a law firm. I’m trying to move out of state in February to March. As much as I love my dad and brothers, ever since my mom died 12 years ago, they caused me a lot of pain. 

My mother loved children and I feel like my dad expects me to be like her. I think children are a blessing and deserve wonderful homes, but I’m not interested in having children of my own any time soon or raising someone else’s. I’m tired of being taken advantage of. My oldest brother doesn’t reach out until he needs me or my dad to watch his youngest kids. My dad volunteers to watch them and then he just pawns them off to me. Every time my nieces come over, I cook for them, clean after them, and take care of them. And my dad just goes on about his day doing whatever he wants, while I stay at home with them. Whenever I don’t feel like dealing with my nieces, he tries to make me feel bad about it. He reminds me that they are my nieces and I need to be there for them. My oldest brother just got a divorce for the third time. He went on and on about how I can relate to my nieces because their kids and their parents are no longer together. I told my dad, my mom dying and my niece’s parents no longer being together are two completely different things. They have their mother and father.

594,family,my grandma is always insistent on ruining holiday get togethers,"Refreshing! This isn’t about vaccine arguments, so buckle up and get ready to digest the long family history of my grandma hating happiness. 

For background, my grandma is what Id like to refer to her as a TV dinner boomer. She was raised during the introduction of mainstream preservatives and is seemingly addicted to literally nothing being fresh ever. 

ALSO, before someone says “maybe you’re just not good at cooking” everyone else in my family literally sneaks over to my house after holidays at her place (I live across the street) to eat an actual dinner. 

So since moving over here and partaking in holidays with my grandma for the past 3 years, heres how it’s gone. 

Thanksgiving 2019: the one and only time I’ve been allowed to host a dinner at my house. everyone is happy! Most people are getting seconds and my grandpa is even going for thirds. My grandma however, says it was an absolute waste of time to make everything from scratch and how pre made stuff is just as good and even better. What a nice thing to hear after spending the last 5 hours cooking amirite?

Christmas 2019: Ive been spoiled according to my grandma and now we need to eat at her house to give our poor taste buds a break from my cooking. We are served an absolutely indulgent serving of 20 cocktail shrimp and 1 package of velveeta (no hate for velveeta, just the portion size) for 10 people. Grandma said she wasn’t hungry. since we as a family are a hive unit, neither were any of us I suppose. Thank God I had my in-laws coming over, because I basically did a repeat of what I made for Thanksgiving and got to go to bed fat and happy. 

Thanksgiving: 2020, oops! Grandmas house again! Even though now I have a baby and my grandma is fully equipped with two small dogs known for literally hunting down children to bite them. I should’ve known better before getting pregnant though, as my grandma always comes first! Dogs barking the whole time as I basically have to hold my baby at chin level and have to eat while standing. This year we were lucky and got to eat an over cooked spiral ham, but she didn’t make the glaze because she hates glaze and so does the hive unit family too I guess. The dry ham was complimented very well by the dry box mashed potatoes (again, no hate, just not prepared well), and nothing to drink except alcohol. Just to take the edge off ya know. Oh and no turkey because “it’s too big, who’s going to eat all that?”. i hate left overs too grandma!

christmas 2020: I can’t tell you how this went as I was being tortured at my SILs house with homemade dinner rolls and ham WITH glaze! 

Thanksgiving 2021: I’m a horrible person and just had my in laws over because I like eating. My mom and brother ate “dinner” at my grandmas house, which was a variety of boxed pre made goods that were made without any consideration of the directions and over cooked turkey. At least they had a turkey this year. But grandma was angry that the house was dirty, meanwhile she could’ve came over to my house and not had to clean or cook one bit. my bad!

AND FINALLY… Christmas 2021! We made a truce, I am cooking and bringing it over to her house so she can still have a mess to complain about. Or at least that’s what I thought. she just now changed our plans, no more dinner (that Ive already bought all the ingredients for) because the absolute angel of a woman has found out Marion’s pizza will send you a raw, pre made pizza just in time for Christmas! I still am accidentally bringing over all my food for my refugee immediate family to eat.

thanks for reading everyone! Sorry for any spelling mistakes I am not proof reading all this.

TLDR; grandma likes to prioritize her own tastes and makes everyone eat boxed foods they don’t like despite me always offering to cook.","my grandma is always insistent on ruining holiday get togethers Refreshing!

595,family,Extended family disowned me because of my child molester Dad,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. It's gonna get messy.

I'm 32. My parents got a divorce when I was young, around 10. The reason was because my Dad sexually, physically, and emotionally abused my sisters and I. My mom was facing charges as well  because she knew about him physically abusing us but didn't stop it. She more or less turned a blind eye because she didn't want to lose her lifestyle. So the end result was her divorcing my dad to make it appear she didn't approve of what he did..After my dad went to prison, my mom mentally and physically checked out. She told me she didn't sign on to be a single parent, and so she would get boyfriends and not come home for weeks at a time. I coped by coming home after school every day and just sleeping in my room. I became a hermit, and still struggle with getting out of bed today.  

My extended family on my mom's side kept their distance from my sisters and I. My mom said they didn't want to be involved in such a trailer trash situation, as they were all well to do and successful people, and felt it was a bad mark on the family. I was never particularly close to them...I just saw them on Holidays. I always felt like trash around them because I was poor and they were loaded. And I was living in squalor while they lived in mansions. I just felt like a dirty, unwanted child around them. 

The problem really came when my Dad got out of prison. I contacted him and seeked a relationship. In hindsight, I shouldn't have. .because at 18, I was not capable of seeing all the damage his abuse had done to me. I was just focused on having a relationship with someone that I thought loved me. My mom found out I was talking to him and told her side of the family, and they all cut me off. They told me it was disrespectful to my mom to speak to my dad after everything he did. They then banned me from coming over for holidays, and wouldn't let me speak to them.

It's been about 10 years since I've seen any of them. I had tried in the past to add my aunts and uncles on Facebook to try to slowly rebuild a relationship with them...but they would instantly decline my request or block me. I could feel their rejection all over again.

I wanted to explain me talking to my dad again was to heal something in me, not hurt my mom. It had nothing to do with my mom...but all the family can think is how could I do this to my mom. 

Which brings me to my next point....My older sister was recently diagnosed with stage 3 cervical cancer. And because of how expensive the treatments are....my extended family recently got into contact with my mom and offered ro buy my sister Christmas gifts for her kids. My mom said the extended relatives told her they feel like they just abandoned us, and shouldn't have. But no one has reached out or will respond to me directly. 

Because of how easy it was for them to leave me, as an abused child...when I needed someone, anyone's support...has me seriously cynical about rekindling a relationship with them, should they even want one. I have closed myself off, emotionally.

I now have a family of my own, 2 beautiful children that my extended family has never met. And I'm not sure if they ever will.

597,family,My parents want me to get married right after my brother. What should I do?,"So my parents, starting next year, have set arranged marriage for my brother who’s currently 23.

599,family,Family cut my hair without my consent. Is it wrong to cut them out of my life?,"I have an extended family on my mum's side that consists of her mother, her 3 sisters and their families. Every single Saturday night I used to go to dinner with them. 

On my aunt's birthday in October, multiple relatives started saying rude things about my hair, which has always been very long because that's how I like it. They said it was unprofessional, wispy, that I never look good, that ""you look like one of your mad patients"" (I work on a psychiatry ward and I found this very insulting to them as well as me). Normally I ignore their judgy comments but I decided that I could use a trim as I hadn't had one for months. I agreed to let my aunt trim 10cm of my hair maximum to get rid of some split ends. They reassured me I would look really nice afterwards and I trusted they would do a good job. I'd never been to a hairdresser but I trusted these people (clearly, more than I should have)

40 mins later, my aunt and her daughter said they were done and it looked ""so nice!!!"" Guess what, I had lost 30cm of my hair. THREE TIMES THE AGREED LENGTH. My hair used to be down to my hips, I could sit on it if I tried, and now it was barely at my nipple line. I was absolutely shellshocked. No one apologised when I said it was so short. My cousin pushed me around to show off her amazing handiwork to everyone, repeatedly exclaiming ""so pretty!!!"" and I kept saying it was much too short, but there wasn't a single family member who stood up for me. The only person who thought it was bad was my twin brother, who asked me how I felt when he drove me home and said he was shocked it turned out like that.

I was devastated and felt I'd lost my identity and my self image destroyed. Also that I'd lost my trust in these people. I cried all night and my parents realised how upset I was the next day and they felt really bad they hadn't supervised the haircut, but they had trusted my relatives too. Unfortunately my partner wasn't there that night and he felt upset about that and cried when he saw me the next day because he is supportive and thoughtful and actually cares about my feelings.

The worst part is that I confronted my aunt and cousin and they were horrible about it. My aunt said ""fine then I won't give you any more advice anymore"" and said ""next time I won't cut your hair again"" and ""sorry you have reacted this way"" as if she had done me a favour that I was crazy to be upset about... And my cousin had the nerve to tell me a) she had a bad haircut in the past which made her feel suicidal (which makes me think why on earth would you do that to me?!) and b) we didn't cut much hair off (I really lost it, how tf do you cut off 30cm of hair and not admit it?!). I was furious and disgusted with them. If they had owned what they did and apologised properly it would've made it so much better, instead of trying to gaslight me into thinking it was my fault for ""reacting badly"". After that they sent me apologetic texts but I felt it was much too late. I only said thank you for their texts because my mum is so enmeshed in the family that she had a breakdown about the situation, and I had to do it for her sake. I spent the whole week extremely upset. My therapist said I'd been through a traumatic experience and it would take me a while to recover, which I resolved to do.

A friend wouldn't do this to me. Yes they are family but it shouldn't mean lower standards are acceptable. Anyone I told about it was immediately horrified at how wrong it was. But no one in my family could see that. No one else reached out to say they were sorry about what happened - and there were probably 15 people there that night. I felt violated. I know my hair will grow back, but it will probably take 2 years and I have to see it every day, while they all carry on tjiughtlessly. The behaviour in this family disgusts me. They think that I should be over it by now. Another of my aunts writes her son's take home essays and everyone praises him for doing well at school. It's like they have no sense of right and wrong 

I haven't been to any Saturday dinners since and haven't missed seeing any of them, although it was nice to play games with my other cousins before; it's really nice having the night free and not have them pass judgement on my appearance or my life choices. I know they've helped me in other ways in the past, but I don't feel that makes their poor behaviour excusable. I've spent my time doing things I enjoy with people who are supportive and respectful, which seems like a much better use of my free time.

The only complication is that my grandmother has been quite unwell for a couple years with kidney failure. I used to visit her most weeks in addition to Saturdays (no other grandchild did that) and we were very close. I called her once since October which was fine. But I'm still upset because she had been bugging me a lot, saying I should get a haircut, and that was one of the contributing factors that led to this happening - I wanted to look neater to make her happy. And she said that we should all get along and refused to condemn my aunt and cousin for what they did. I'm just worried that something bad will happen to her and I won't have seen her. I've been sick for 3 weeks with a bad cough so I probably couldn't visit anyway, but I am going to Christmas dinner for a short while just because it's not worth causing more trouble... but honestly I really wish I didn't have to go. 

Upon reflection, I've realised that my extended family is probably quite toxic and my life would probably be happier without them. Is it wrong for me to cut them out of my life? 

Any thoughts appreciated. It's been a rough couple of months for me. I'm still upset when I think about it. In two years my long hair will be back but I don't know if I'll ever think positively of my relatives again.

The only person who thought it was bad was my twin brother, who asked me how I felt when he drove me home and said he was shocked it turned out like that.

I was devastated and felt I'd lost my identity and my self image destroyed. Also that I'd lost my trust in these people. I cried all night and my parents realised how upset I was the next day and they felt really bad they hadn't supervised the haircut, but they had trusted my relatives too. Unfortunately my partner wasn't there that night and he felt upset about that and cried when he saw me the next day because he is supportive and thoughtful and actually cares about my feelings.

The worst part is that I confronted my aunt and cousin and they were horrible about it. My aunt said ""fine then I won't give you any more advice anymore"" and said ""next time I won't cut your hair again"" and ""sorry you have reacted this way"" as if she had done me a favour that I was crazy to be upset about... And my cousin had the nerve to tell me a) she had a bad haircut in the past which made her feel suicidal (which makes me think why on earth would you do that to me?!) and b) we didn't cut much hair off (I really lost it, how tf do you cut off 30cm of hair and not admit it?!). I was furious and disgusted with them. If they had owned what they did and apologised properly it would've made it so much better, instead of trying to gaslight me into thinking it was my fault for ""reacting badly"". After that they sent me apologetic texts but I felt it was much too late. I only said thank you for their texts because my mum is so enmeshed in the family that she had a breakdown about the situation, and I had to do it for her sake. I spent the whole week extremely upset. My therapist said I'd been through a traumatic experience and it would take me a while to recover, which I resolved to do.

A friend wouldn't do this to me. Yes they are family but it shouldn't mean lower standards are acceptable. Anyone I told about it was immediately horrified at how wrong it was. But no one in my family could see that. No one else reached out to say they were sorry about what happened - and there were probably 15 people there that night. I felt violated. I know my hair will grow back, but it will probably take 2 years and I have to see it every day, while they all carry on tjiughtlessly. The behaviour in this family disgusts me. They think that I should be over it by now. Another of my aunts writes her son's take home essays and everyone praises him for doing well at school. It's like they have no sense of right and wrong 

I haven't been to any Saturday dinners since and haven't missed seeing any of them, although it was nice to play games with my other cousins before; it's really nice having the night free and not have them pass judgement on my appearance or my life choices. I know they've helped me in other ways in the past, but I don't feel that makes their poor behaviour excusable. I've spent my time doing things I enjoy with people who are supportive and respectful, which seems like a much better use of my free time.

The only complication is that my grandmother has been quite unwell for a couple years with kidney failure. I used to visit her most weeks in addition to Saturdays (no other grandchild did that) and we were very close. I called her once since October which was fine. But I'm still upset because she had been bugging me a lot, saying I should get a haircut, and that was one of the contributing factors that led to this happening - I wanted to look neater to make her happy. And she said that we should all get along and refused to condemn my aunt and cousin for what they did. I'm just worried that something bad will happen to her and I won't have seen her. I've been sick for 3 weeks with a bad cough so I probably couldn't visit anyway, but I am going to Christmas dinner for a short while just because it's not worth causing more trouble... but honestly I really wish I didn't have to go. 

Upon reflection, I've realised that my extended family is probably quite toxic and my life would probably be happier without them. Is it wrong for me to cut them out of my life? 

Any thoughts appreciated. It's been a rough couple of months for me. I'm still upset when I think about it. In two years my long hair will be back but I don't know if I'll ever think positively of my relatives again. 

Tldr: my aunt and cousin cut off 30cm of my hair when I agreed to 10cm. Realised that my relatives are probably quite toxic. Is cutting them out bad?"

I’ve got a toxic gaslighting sibling- but i didn’t realise that’s what they were doing until recently when I’ve had some significant life events happen - i knew they weren’t helpful or supportive and every conversation with them I felt bad about myself but I didn’t realise how or why and I couldn’t go back and pick specific words cause it was so subtle - but looking back it was gaslighting and I feel so disgusted. They were actually putting me down. This is sick and twisted as there is a significant gap between us in terms of years so there was no reason to put me down. Parents ignored this behaviour/ never challenged as older sibling was “successful” in and were hoping to be a good influence.  To point we both have good jobs/ independent.  Parents have acknowledged this all now but Damage has already been done.

Relationship with parents has also been strained and I had to cut off contact with them for a while although they’ve since apologised and whilst we are okey now I’ve got strict boundaries in place. I’ve cut sibling out of my life completely for now. I don’t intend to re-establish a relationship other than polite one. I don’t see the point in going home for Xmas and pretending we are all one big happy family.

I just feel like a loser. What are you supposed to do when your family is like this ? Esp at Xmas which is all about happy family and no matter how crappy your family is - to put “differences aside”. There’s a limit to how much to put up with and gaslighting isn’t one :( it’s just shit.","Toxic family members Is anyone else going to be spending Xmas by themselves or not with family ?

601,family,I feel like I’m parenting my mom,"TL;DR: my mom is very manipulative and has emotional outbursts and it’s difficult to communicate with her in a healthy way. 


Growing up my mom was very abusive, physically and emotionally. By the time I was 16 I moved out of my moms house cuz I was extremely suicidal and failing at school. When I was 17 I got into my first healthy relationship and it honestly showed me a lot of ugly about myself. I’m pretty self aware person, watching my emotional unstable ass while my partner did nothing but support me and help me was a major wake up call. I’ve been working really hard on healing from my childhood trauma with the tools that I have (I’m hoping to find a therapist but it’s really hard rn). When I was 18 I decided to reconnect with my mom and try to fix our relationship. I’m 21 now, about six months ago I moved in with my mom because of financial reasons. She practically begged me to come stay with her. I have been so miserable, I feel like I’m back tracking on a lot of my healing and falling back into a lot of unhealthy patterns. Dealing with my mom sometimes is like dealing with a teen in an adult body. I’m constantly having to be the one to try to install healthy forms of communication but it’s so difficult. I myself am still working on how to communicate properly and process my emotions in a healthy way so doing so with another person who is not open to it is basically impossible. I see a lot of myself in my mom, it’s very triggering for me. She has very little control of her emotions, gets very defensive and always turns to manipulative tactics. 

For example: Last night she got upset about dishes in the sink (my brothers are pigs, I get seriously upset about it too). She’s yelling about the dishes and then she starts saying things out of anger. “Oh but when I get mad and I yell I’m a bad mom, I’m causing you guys trauma, I don’t need this I don’t need any of you I’m done with all of you”.  I ask her to please stop saying those things, it feels manipulative. I know shes upset but it doesn’t give her the right to say things like that, her saying these things isn’t helping solve the problem and there are better ways to communicate it. She then starts yelling about how I’m manipulating her by saying this and that she doesn’t care she’s going to kill herself and she wants me out the house by the end of the month. At this point im trying not to laugh, because I’m both upset and in disbelief that she doesn’t realize the things coming out of her mouth. Fast forward to this morning and she tries talking to me like nothing happen (she always does this, she rarely apologizes). I’m still upset about last night and feel like I might say things I regret in the moment so I tell her I really don’t to talk to her right now. She gets upset and starts ranting about how I have an attitude and she’s sick and tired of my shit and so on. Hasn’t spoken to me all day, now I feel obligated to try and fix it. I kind of already get the sense of how the conversation is going to go but I know it’s not healthy to just leave things unsaid like this. 

I’m actively looking for a place to live even though I’m not sure I can really afford it. I have a really good savings but she’s borrowed nearly all of it and this is a big sum of money so I don’t think she can pay it back by the end of the month. I feel stuck. I really don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve been feeling very suicidal lately but I’m trying to be strong for my fur babies.","I feel like I’m parenting my mom TL;DR: my mom is very manipulative and has emotional outbursts and it’s difficult to communicate with her in a healthy way.

602,family,My parents are making me choose again…,"For reference I am a single 38yo female. I’ve been through a lot in my life, overcame many obstacles and still managed to make a decent life for myself and two kids and niece (who lives w me). Recently I graduated from college. It took me many years and it was hard working and being a single parent. I did it through the pandemic, homeschooling three kids and working 12 hr shifts overnight. During that time there were a lot of other craptastic things that happened like having to get my gallbladder out, a hysterectomy etc. long story short, I’m really proud. 
My mom and dad have been divorced since I was 2 and my mom lives out of state. I have only seen her a handful of times since I was 15 so I can pretty much count her out. My dad and (stepmom) were married since I was 12 or so. I didn’t initially get along with my stepmom however over the years we have grown to be very close. Her and my dad divorced about 10 years ago in what was a very bitter divorce. He actually left my stepmom for her (younger than me) niece who was living with them. Over the last several years my dad has been pretty absent while my stepmom calls me regularly and helps with the kids. Long story short, I cannot invite them both to my graduation as they refuse to see each other. So I’m torn between inviting my stepmom and my dad. I feel like I should invite my stepmom as she has been the one that has been there for me and helped me through all this, but my dad is my dad and as time goes on I feel us drifting further and further apart. I guess I just need advice on what to do, words of wisdom or something. Thanks in advance.","My parents are making me choose again… For reference I am a single 38yo female.

603,family,I want to get to know my Half-Sisters that currently don't know I exist,"My Mom fell pregnant with me (29F) in her final year of college by her then boyfriend (my Birth Dad). They decided to have me and he even proposed to her to take responsibility but she decided not to marry for the sake of a child and they ended up breaking up awhile after.

Eventually, my Mom got married and her husband legally adopted me. Meanwhile, my Birth Dad went on to start his own family. I still have a relationship with him and see him a couple of times a year. Most people in his side of the family actually know about me and are very welcoming of me, EXCEPT his 2 daughters (22F &amp; 18F). His wife did not want her children knowing about me. She seemed okay with me when they were dating, but that all changed when they got married. I accepted the situation as that's their decision to make, though it has made me feel a little rejected growing up.

More and more as I'm getting older &amp; my Half-Sisters are reaching adulthood, I wish I could have a relationship with them one day.

1. Is that too selfish to ask for?
2. Have any of you been the surprised Half-Sibling? Would you rather have found out or not?
3. If any of you have been on my end of a similar situation, what did you do? I have no idea how I would even go about broaching the subject since it's been so many years, and his side of the family tends to be avoidant of difficult topics.

604,family,I worry a lot about my mom,"I (34f) worry a lot about my mom (70f) because she has these health problems, and for years, she hasn’t really been doing what the doctors have been telling her to do (eat well and exercise often). 

When I turned 9, she took me with her to move to another state because she and my dad divorced and she took a good job offer. My mom and I grew close, and it has mostly been just me and her. 

Because of her divorce and working a bunch to be able to make enough to support me, she grew stressed throughout the years and eventually developed high blood pressure. She worked really hard as a single mother, and I appreciate every bit of it! She became very independent and had many admirers at work. She was a wonderful role model, and I look up to her until this day…except for one thing; She was so busy working and taking care of me that she never remarried and never took care of herself. As a result, she is growing old with no companion except for our dog, and her health has not been great. 

When I turned 15, her work decided to allow her to work from home. She got used to always being in her office and working with people from other countries, so she never got enough sleep. She had to work around other time zones, and it robbed her from ever getting restful sleep. I remember I would go to bed and see her in a conference call….then I’d get up for work in the morning and she would STILL be up working, sometimes still on a conference call. She was a workaholic! But of course, she did it because she wanted to be financially stable.

She used to be very physically active. On the weekends, she did yard work. During weekdays, she would practice ballroom dancing, and on some evenings she would take the dog and go jogging. She took good care of herself, dressed up nicely, and always fixed her hair and make up and always wore heels! Shoot, I rarely ever wear heels.

Anyway, she ended up dating this guy. They were together throughout my high school years and beginning of college (11 years). They were very happy. One day, Her boyfriend’s kids moved to this state and his daughter was always very mean to my mom. This issue had eventually driven her away, and so they broke up. 

After they broke up, she continued to work a lot. Because she worked from home, she began to become lazy around the house because she was used to sitting all the time. I am sure she was also very sad that her relationship had ended, so she did not feel very motivated. She stopped dressing up and taking care of herself, and the way she stressed out a lot made her age quickly. Her knees eventually got bad and she gained a lot of weight. She got knee replacement surgery for both knees. During her rehab, she learned to use her knees again, but since she still kept on a lot of weight, her ankles started hurting. Her doctors keep telling her to lose weight and to go walking daily, but she never wants to. If she starts walking for a few minutes, she starts feeling pain and so she stops. I recommended her to go to the swimming pool, but she’s so dependent on me, she refuses to go by herself. I honestly think that’s just an excuse to not go. I don’t know. I wish she could take good care of herself because I do not want to lose her.

605,family,I despise my relatives,"This may be a little dark so be warned.

Idk why I'm saying this, guess I just want to let it out. I'm a 16 year old boy which is an only child. I have 5 uncles and 1 aunt as well as a fuckload of cousins I can't be bothered to count. Now to explain who I hate and why I hate them. I love my mom, aunt and grandma; I dislike the rest and hate a specific few well all my uncles fit into that specific few category because they all are a bunch of ungrateful, untalented, worthless scum on earth. My mother, ever since she was a child, put others ahead of herself thus she never genuinely enjoyed her life. She always thought “Instead of buying this new expensive shirt I can spend it to buy food for my brothers” personally I find it naive to think like this because one time when she bought an ENTIRE house for one of my fuckhead uncles, behind her back they called her a whore and other vulgar things. Whenever I hear her talk about this my blood boils, I'm usually a composed guy always trying to think rationally instead of emotionally but my mother is a rare case. I want to bang my head into a wall. They always bad mouthed her when she didn't help them and even when she did they'd say the same things. I won't go into too much detail but one of my uncles lives with us now and he talks to me sometimes. I act cool with him but whenever I see him I get angry. He's the one who called my mom the worst things, my mom always helped him the most. Buying cars, houses land everything a person needs for him and what does he do? Blame his fuck ups on her. “Its her fault I lost everything” no you lost everything because you were too busy doing drugs and fucking to know what to do. Same goes for my cousins, they act friendly with me near my mom but when she isn't around they all act like pieces of shit. I can't fathom how they all act so fucking immature blaming shit on my mother. As for my father, I rarely see him. So I haven't got too attached, my mom respects him but I don't. He spent more time with his other mistresses and older kids to give a fuck about us. I don't hate him but I don't love him either. One of my cousins committed suicide last year. He was doing meth or sth. Guess what my uncle says to everyone in the family. He blames it on my mother because my mother praised one of my actually good cousins for not being an ungrateful cunt. My mom only said that “He is a very helpful boy” idk how that drives a person to go jump off 13 floors. Anyways at the funeral my uncle's wife said “My son died because he was poor” and other delusional shit like that. Hearing this disgusted me to an incomprehensible extent where I didn't feel a hint of sadness. I was too angry to cry. Just because my mother is more successful than all of them combined doesn't mean she is obligated to pay for their children. That's a parents job not the other relatives. My mom was too patient with them and still worries about them. If I was in her place I'd already leave them in pieces for everything they've done and all the things they've called my mother. I only hold back from fighting with them to keep my mom happy if it weren't for her I'd already destroy all of their self confidence as I know all of their weak points. 
Anyways sorry for the long read you prolly didn't read the whole thing which is fine cause I wouldn't but thanks anyways.","I despise my relatives This may be a little dark so be warned.

She always thought “Instead of buying this new expensive shirt I can spend it to buy food for my brothers” personally I find it naive to think like this because one time when she bought an ENTIRE house for one of my fuckhead uncles, behind her back they called her a whore and other vulgar things. Whenever I hear her talk about this my blood boils, I'm usually a composed guy always trying to think rationally instead of emotionally but my mother is a rare case. I want to bang my head into a wall. They always bad mouthed her when she didn't help them and even when she did they'd say the same things. I won't go into too much detail but one of my uncles lives with us now and he talks to me sometimes. I act cool with him but whenever I see him I get angry. He's the one who called my mom the worst things, my mom always helped him the most. Buying cars, houses land everything a person needs for him and what does he do? Blame his fuck ups on her. “Its her fault I lost everything” no you lost everything because you were too busy doing drugs and fucking to know what to do. Same goes for my cousins, they act friendly with me near my mom but when she isn't around they all act like pieces of shit. I can't fathom how they all act so fucking immature blaming shit on my mother. As for my father, I rarely see him. So I haven't got too attached, my mom respects him but I don't. He spent more time with his other mistresses and older kids to give a fuck about us. I don't hate him but I don't love him either. One of my cousins committed suicide last year. He was doing meth or sth. Guess what my uncle says to everyone in the family. He blames it on my mother because my mother praised one of my actually good cousins for not being an ungrateful cunt. My mom only said that “He is a very helpful boy” idk how that drives a person to go jump off 13 floors. Anyways at the funeral my uncle's wife said “My son died because he was poor” and other delusional shit like that. Hearing this disgusted me to an incomprehensible extent where I didn't feel a hint of sadness. I was too angry to cry. Just because my mother is more successful than all of them combined doesn't mean she is obligated to pay for their children. That's a parents job not the other relatives. My mom was too patient with them and still worries about them. If I was in her place I'd already leave them in pieces for everything they've done and all the things they've called my mother. I only hold back from fighting with them to keep my mom happy if it weren't for her I'd already destroy all of their self confidence as I know all of their weak points. 
Anyways sorry for the long read you prolly didn't read the whole thing which is fine cause I wouldn't but thanks anyways."

607,family,Is my mom okay??,"I’m not sure if my mom is okay.

She works a really stressful job and has expressed wanting to quit, she takes the stress out on the rest of my family. But I don’t know if it is just stress anymore because it has evolved into her instantly switching her mood, one second she is happy and just being a mom and one second she is screaming at me for something I may not have even done. I’ve expressed concern to her before about her maybe being bipolar or something but she immediately got offended and started screaming at me again. 

This keeps happening multiple times a day and it feels really abusive when she is screaming mean names at me and getting my dad to do the same, it’s relentless and when she feels like she did something wrong or is in the wrong she refuses to accept it and just starts screaming until you admit she’s right.","Is my mom okay??

608,family,Dealing with sibling estrangement,"Almost two years ago my older sister cut off most contact with me and my other two siblings during the height of lockdown.

She and I were very close but we had a complicated relationship over the years due to our childhoods. We had our ups and downs like any other sibling dynamic but when she stopped talking to me over circumstances that were entirely down to her and her own fault, I took it incredibly bad as she blamed what happened on me.

Over the last 18 months, she has taken zero responsibility for her actions and we have only met up in person once (which was my idea) to discuss everything and apologise for what happened but it went nowhere. Since then, I  have suggested meeting again which she bluntly refused and we continued to go months without speaking to one another. She also didn't message me on my birthday which upset me, as I've always wished her happy birthday, sent Christmas cards etc.

With the festive season here, I'm finding it hard because she has made effort to see other family members including my siblings but not me. I believe she is doing this to upset me and I feel completely at a loss with her. I believe our relationship is dead, she has made no real effort to want to fix things between us and I believe she does not care for me anymore. My father is also causing me a lot of grief because he believes I should keep trying with her, despite knowing the effort I have already made. 

I have had counselling to help deal with what happened to me and my sister but this time of year makes things even worse. I want to repair our relationship but I can't bring myself to contact her again, I feel like a total mug and just want her to take some ownership and responsibility for once. What should I do?","Dealing with sibling estrangement Almost two years ago my older sister cut off most contact with me and my other two siblings during the height of lockdown.

609,family,Racist family members,"I (18F) am the eldest of five siblings. My dad is quite racist and set in his ways and sometimes makes racist comments which really annoys me. He “justifies” his reasons when I ask him but they are ridiculous obviously and disgusting. My mum doesn’t really do anything and laughs sometimes but also says racism is wrong which doesn’t make sense. The main problem is my sister (14F) she is quite racist, though not to peoples faces. At home she will make rude comments and jokes that are racist, says the n word and every time  I tell her not to or try to explain why it’s wrong she laughs as if it’s a joke and doesn’t take me seriously. I’m not even sure where she learnt all this stuff since no one else in my family is vocally racist like this. At this point I ignore her because it’s like she does it on purpose to get to me but it does really piss me off and I don’t get why she does it. She always acts as if darker skinned people are less prettier than fair people which is ridiculous since we are Asian and technically “brown” but even then she comments on peoples skin colour in our family being darker as if it’s a bad thing. Also since no one in my family really cares about my sisters racist comments I’m scared my two younger brothers will think this kind of behaviour is okay and replicate it which I don’t want at all. I will obviously tell them it’s wrong but they might see that no one else in my family really cares and also not listen to me. Is there any advice anyone can give me.","Racist family members I (18F) am the eldest of five siblings.

616,HomeImprovement,Roofing Company broke my furnace’s ventilation system in my attic - DIFFERENT POST,"Please note **this is a different post from the popular one right now.** I thought it was really funny the title is similar to what we’re dealing with now. 

We just bought a house this Friday, Dec 17th. Yesterday my husband went into the attic to store some supplies and noted the ventilation pipes from one of the furnaces has been entirely sheared apart. 

The roofers completed their work December 16th. Before then, we had inspections done by a general home inspector and an HVAC specialist and they noted no issues. I already had the Inspector confirm the ventilation pipe was fine and properly connected. I’m still waiting to hear back from the HVAC specialist on this particular pipe, but in their report they noted the whole system was in good standing. Both these inspections occured before the reroofing. 

So we know this damage occurred with the work the roofers did. 

My husband said he can’t reconnect the pipes as he can’t get them to budge. We probably need a specialist to come out to repair it. 

We asked the roofer to send someone from HVAC out to help with repairs since the roofing team damaged this ventilation, and he responded with laughing emojis and calling my husband “weak” in later texts. 

He claimed the ventilation failed due to “bad plumbing.” 

https://imgur.com/a/U0WWFYB/

^ Here’s the initial texts and pictures of the damage. 

I wanted feedback on if this does fall under the roofer’s liability, and also if there was any issues with the ventilation design? They keep claiming that it’s not their responsibility because the ventilation design was “shoddy” even though the HVAC tech at the time said it was fine. I’m hoping to get feedback from the HVAC tech soon. 

Is there a risk of CO filling the attic? 

I figure since they’re being belligerent, if it is their responsibility we can just pay for HVAC to repair and go to small claims to formally make them responsible for the bill.","Roofing Company broke my furnace’s ventilation system in my attic - DIFFERENT POST Please note **this is a different post from the popular one right now.** I thought it was really funny the title is similar to what we’re dealing with now.

620,HomeImprovement,OK to clean dungeon bathroom?,"Hi all! New here, would appreciate any advice or information you can provide!

I Just bought\_a\_house with a ""dungeon"" bathroom in the basement. The goal is to renovate it at some point but I'd like to clean it up at least a little bit before getting a contractor to come look at it, HOWEVER, the house inspector suspects the flooring may be asbestos so I am hesitant to do anything in there at the moment.

Everyone I've asked says asbestos is harmless as long as you don't ""disturb"" it but from the looks of it, it appears ""disturbed"" already. Many of the tiles are broken and could be removed but again I don't know enough and am hesitant to do anything in there. 

So my question is: would it be okay for me to get a shop-vac and start cleaning out this area, or should I avoid doing anything in the murder bathroom until I have a professional come look at it.

Thanks again for any info or advice. Much appreciated!

623,HomeImprovement,‘Fired’ a contractor and now they are asking for a large amount of money for the work they did. Looking for advice.,"My wife’s sister hired a contractor to completely redo her kitchen including creating a new opening with French doors to the backyard.

The workers came and gutted the whole kitchen, removing the floors and the drywall as well as cut an opening to the outside where the French doors will go. This took ~2days of work. During the night they covered the opening where the door will go with plastic but nothing else. 

She called the contractor several days asking them to put some sort of plywood over the opening at night. Not just to keep any bugs/animals/rain out but also for safety. The contractor more or less blew her off saying he was really busy and he would have someone do it, but they never did. Eventually a neighbor helped put up some plywood to cover the opening. 

She told him to either put up some plywood that night or don’t bother coming back. Well he never came. 

He wants her to pay $8000 for the work they did complete, but she feels like this is unreasonable and is willing to pay $5000 for the work. 

Normally, I would say it depends on the contract, but no contract was ever signed. 

This is in California. What is your take on the situation?  Should she just tell him take the 5000 or take me to court?  Does $8000 seem reasonable cost for removing the existing kitchen cabinets and cutting open a hole for the French doors?

Before we bought our house, the home inspector said we should clear the soil away from the siding on one side of our house. The soil goes right up to the siding. The foundation is brick, with a crawlspace on the other side of it. In the crawlspace, there are at least 3 rows of brick exposed, so the dirt is definitely higher on the outside. This is a mostly-original part of a late 1890s house.

I finally got around to digging a test hole, and I was able to expose 4 rows of brick, plus 2 more rows that are wider than the 4 above. In the pictures, the bricks look wet - I sprayed them to get some dirt off, they weren't wet when I dug them out. That said, drainage is an ongoing concern on this side of the house.

I know this isn't good. The bricks themselves seem to be in pretty good shape, at least. I noticed bits of insulation that fell from the bottom of the siding as I dug, so this was/is a rodent expressway. My question is: how much of the foundation should be exposed? And, is it necessary to have some sort of professional evaluate the foundation, since it's presumably been buried for a long time? Anything else to consider?","My foundation is REALLY buried Images: https://imgur.com/a/lGrlQfh

631,HomeImprovement,Help! Claim of mechanics lien..,"This is in California. Not strictly related to home improvement ideas but I’m lost and want to seek opinions from experienced folks here…


About 2 months ago, we hired a contractor for a $30k job, out of which $5k was supposed to be paid to the supplier. 

Last week we received a letter Claim of Mechanics’ Lien from the supplier. It seems to me that they were never paid despite I verbally confirmed with the contractors office that they were paying the supplier after receiving my full payment $30k. 

Due to inexperience, we didn’t ask for release of lien or using joint check. But only verbally confirmed with contractors office that they paid the supplier. 

It turned out that the contractor company is dissolving due to some internal drama. Before this the contractor has great review and is licensed and insured. We are also satisfied with their work. 

I want to ask what are my options now that the supplier has already put a mechanics lien on my property? Worst comes worst we could pay them the $5k again just to avoid they filing a foreclose action to sell our home, and ask them to release the lien. We may be able to get a refund back from the contractor once they liquidate their assets and have leftover cash…

My biggest concern is how likely the supplier will file a foreclose action against my home and evict my family, over a $5k lien? And if it happens, is there anything the homeowner can do to avoid the house being sold??

633,HomeImprovement,Is it a bad idea to hire a licensed plumber to do work on the side? (not guaranteed),"Edit: Title should say (not guaranteed by a company insurance policy) - the guy said that he'd fix any issues if they arose, but insisted that there wouldn't be any issues.

We're in the process of remodeling our master bathroom.  We got a plumbing quote from one of the larger local companies and they said the job was ""cut and dry"" &amp; ""pretty easy""... yet, the quote for labor alone was $3700.

After seeing that, I asked for recommendations on Facebook and had 3 separate people (one of which is a pretty smart farmer who I trust) recommend the same person/company.  I reached out to the guy that was recommended and sent him detailed pictures of what I am needing and he said that he and his friend (both licensed plumbers) would be able to do the job for $2000 max.  That said, in order to get the $2k price, they wouldn't be completing the work under their company so the work would not have their company guarantee.

Is it a bad idea to use them and save $1700 on labor?  The job involves the following:

\- capping some old shower lines and covering the drain.  (We're turning the old shower into a closet.)

\- moving water lines from preexisting jet tub to newly framed shower.  (the shower wall is about 2 feet away from the water lines from the tub)

\- moving jet tub drain over to the new shower (\~4 feet from existing drain location)

\- shifting sink water lines over a few inches to account for narrower double vanity and make the water lines come out from the wall instead of the floor

\- reinstall existing toilet in the same location

I sent him the parts list.  We're using delta fixtures (showerhead, hand sprayer, 3 setting/2 port diverter, universal rough-in valve, diverter rough-in valve).  So he should have a good sense of what is needed.  Is this a no-brainer, or a hair-brained idea?

634,HomeImprovement,How do I know if my panel has enough capacity for future upgrades?,"I have two 200 amp panels in my home but I also have lots of appliances and power hungry devices. I'm currently considering replacing my evaporative humidifier with a steam humidifier, but it requires a dedicated 240v breaker and I don't want to take this option at the expense of future upgradability. Another option would be to go for a higher capacity evaporative humidifier which would simply plug into a nearby outlet next to my furnaces. The downside is that evaporative humidifiers are less effective than steam humidifiers (or so I've read).

Any help?","How do I know if my panel has enough capacity for future upgrades? I have two 200 amp panels in my home but I also have lots of appliances and power hungry devices. I'm currently considering replacing my evaporative humidifier with a steam humidifier, but it requires a dedicated 240v breaker and I don't want to take this option at the expense of future upgradability. Another option would be to go for a higher capacity evaporative humidifier which would simply plug into a nearby outlet next to my furnaces. The downside is that evaporative humidifiers are less effective than steam humidifiers (or so I've read).

635,HomeImprovement,Flat paint has a sheen,"We painted out family room yesterday with flat Valspar signature paint. Today we looked at it and it looks like eggshell.

I  discovered severe water damage to the rim joist and two floor joists  just under the front door. There is a single step at the front door.

The right way is to   jackha mmer the front step and I guess demo a bunch of the brick to  expose the rim joist for replacement. Then, jackhammer/dig up the dirt  (very hard and rocky). I wanted to see if there was any possible way you  can do this without demoing below the door to expose the rim joist.

642,HomeImprovement,Advice on Removing Tile Adhesive from Slab,"Hello again fellow redditors!

This is a follow up from a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/p6iddx/advice_on_removing_vinyl_tile/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), in which I asked about removing old vinyl tile from concrete slab. I tried a bunch of methods suggested from that post. For those of you curious, about 80% of the tile came up fairly easily with a simple tile scraper. For the tile that seemed to be fixed with super-glue, I finally rented an electric floor stripper (like [this one](https://imgur.com/a/8QGQei1)) to finish the kitchen and one of the bedrooms.

Now I have exposed all my concrete floors but there is a layer of adhesive remaining on the concrete that I would like to remove. You can see in [these](https://imgur.com/a/kH5PRn7) [photos](https://imgur.com/a/KyC5TCK), from the kitchen &amp; dining room respectively.

I want to keep the concrete as the finish floor for at least a year or two. It's a nice red and I prefer the look. I've had a few people tell me I need a floor grinder to remove the top layer of adhesive &amp; concrete. This is fine with me, but I was curious what the group thought.

Option 1: rent a [Lavina 16e](https://www.granquartz.com/catalog/product/view/id/99107/s/lavina-16e-16-grinder-3-7-heads-1ph-115v-2-45hp/) from a company in town that specializes in floor tools. This is pricey -- about $700 after taxes but seems the most 'pro' and robust solution. That price is per day, but they don't charge for weekend days, so I only pay for 1 day for the weekend (Friday - Monday). That price includes the diamond grinders and an attachable vacuum.

Option 2: rent a more affordable version, like [this one](https://imgur.com/a/9odMihy) with a [coating removal disc](https://imgur.com/a/7qExGFJ), from Home Depot or sim. They are like $200 a day after taxes, but they also charge 7 days a week.

I ask for thoughts because $700 isn't cheap exactly, but I want to do it right. I know this is going to make a huge mess (like I said, the $700 includes the vacuum and I'll wear PPE). I want to take care of it before I do much more finish work and move in. That said, I also don't want to go overboard and grind the concrete excessively if I don't have to. Any thoughts / advice would be greatly appreciated!

As a follow-up, I don't really want to paint or stain the floor or anything. The tile has been removed in the [laundry room](https://imgur.com/a/uCFdtsj) and it doesn't look like there is a finish or sealant on it. Do I need to coat the floor with anything?

644,HomeImprovement,Fix cold floors over encapsulated crawl space,"Location: Los Angeles, CA

Looking for ideas to prevent cold floors in my house. My house is built above a crawl space which I had encapsulated earlier this year with 20mil vapor barrier, foam boards and spray foam on foundation, and dehumidifier. 

I still think the floors – wood throughout the house and tile in the bathrooms – are too cold in the winter. 

Is there anything I can do to keep the floor more comfortable? 

I saw a Rockwool video where they put batts under the floor boards (in that case it was an outdoor space). 

Would doing this be overkill or actually provide some benefit? I can’t think of any downsides, especially with mold since we already have a vapor barrier on the dirt and a dehumidifier, aside from cost. It may also help dampen sound.

10. ""Finished"" one corner of the basement, where the washers and dryers will be. No walls were put up.

655,HomeImprovement,Tiny amounts/drops of water between floorboard seams.,"I discovered very small amounts of water between 3-4 vinyl planks boards in the middle of the kitchen. When I mean small amounts of water, I mean the tiniest amount. You need to press on the seams really damn hard to get even 1 drop to show. It's been raining lately, but I'm not sure if that's the issue. I've noticed that the water only appears at night when it's raining. In the morning, it's dry, but the rain has also been letting up in the morning. I'm not sure what the subfloor in the kitchen is, but the rest of the house is plywood subfloor. 

House is located in Sacramento, California and was built in 2003 on a concrete slab, no basement or crawlspace. The kitchen is next to the laundry room/garage. Garage is completely dry and the house is above grade I believe, it's a few inches higher than the garage. I've checked all the surrounding drywall and nothing is wet. The wet seams are in the middle of the kitchen, not close to the fridge or sink. Dishwasher hasn't been used in a while and is completely dry. Cabinets under sink are also dry. What could this be? Slab foundation leak? My water heater isn't running 24/7 so I don't think it's a leak there. Do I call a plumber? What should I do?

However, when I tested the outside of my house, multiple places had 10 ppm or higher.  In addition , under my house (basement) had 100 ppm.  I have a two year old and a baby on the way and just wanted to know if these levels are OK?  My kid constantly puts his hands in his mouth and plays with dirt.  I can’t really find anything online other than play grounds allow 400 ppm and any amount of lead dust is dangerous.  Which confused me.","Lead levels out doors after Home Improvement Hello All,

672,HomeImprovement,Suggestions for creating a soft fill area for backyard playhouse,"I am planning to build a playhouse in our backyard and am looking for advice.

The place we want to put the playhouse is a concrete patio that abuts against the house on two sides and artificial turf on the other two sides. Our current thinking is to leave the concrete in place since we'd prefer not going through the effort of ripping it up while also preserving the option of tearing down the structure in 10 years and having a patio again. However, another factor we are considering is that the drain in the middle of the patio is clogged with roots. I believe it drains very slowly, but leaves a good size puddle after a rainstorm. We are in southern California though, so rains are infrequent.

Per guidelines, the soft fill is supposed to be 12"", compressing down to 9"". So my tentative plan is to create a wooden wall around the area to contain the soft fill. I am think wood chips most likely. The wall would be directly against the house and then extend onto the artificial turf on the other sides. I might have some sort of standoff at the bottom with wire mesh (to allow drainage underneath), or maybe just put the wood chips directly on the ground. My concept was then to have a PVC tube sticking up out of the drain that would create a way to drain water using a shop vac. I would just stick the vacuum down the tube and suck up the water.

I would try to anchor the structure directly into the concrete I think.

Questions:  

Does my plan to deal with the water have any problems? Is it necessary? A better way to do it?  

How to anchor the structure to the ground?  

I'm a little unclear on how the structure mounts to the ground as related to the soft fill... I assume you anchor it to the ground and then add the fill, meaning you simply lose the bottom 9"" of the structure which is now below ground level? Is there some other way to do it like raise the foundation using wood?

706,HomeImprovement,Crawlspace encapsulation questions.,"Hello everyone. I recently had my crawlspace encapsulated by a company. I just had a few questions. They put 2in insulation boards all around the sides, and this plastic flooring stuff down. Then they put that white plastic on top of that. They also wrapped the concrete pillars. Is the white plastic supposed to cover those 2in boards? It goes up about a foot or two. But doesn't cover the whole thing. 

I also had them rebuild the crawlspace door. Their rebuild consisted of two pressure treated 2x4s and a white plastic board. They said it's high density polypropylene. Is that worth $400? The whole thing is held on to the house with 4 wing nuts. I don't really think it's worth $400 for two 2x4s and a 3ftx3ft plastic board. I wish i could post pictures. I feel like it's not worth $400. They sent me pictures of a rebuilt door and it looks nothing like mine. That door actually looks like $400. It has a nice frame and is black. What can i do? I already signed off on the project.","Crawlspace encapsulation questions. Hello everyone. I recently had my crawlspace encapsulated by a company. I just had a few questions.

707,HomeImprovement,Weatherproofing door,"Hello all,

New homeowner here in the PNW and what I thought would just be weatherproofing my back door turned into much, much more (shocker).

Our home was built in the early 40s and the previous owners did a lot of projects on their own. There are mostly original hardwoods throughout the home except near the back door. It's a cement brick foundation with a basement, and when it rains really hard sometimes we get a little water in the basement, and the area near the door gets pretty wet. There was a significant gap around the door so I figured it needed some new strips and maybe a door sweep so I brought myself down to the HD and got some. After realizing that the threshold   
[https://imgur.com/i5vRlfq](https://imgur.com/i5vRlfq) needed to be replaced, I bought a new one. I ripped up the old threshold, and found (what I thought was a 2'' x 6'') was rotten and also needed to be replaced. When I tried to pull that up, I realized it was under the flooring on the inside of the house, so up it goes. I'm sure you all can see where I'm going with all this, essentially the framing, sill, and subflooring all need to go   
[https://imgur.com/TxpRoOn](https://imgur.com/TxpRoOn)

 Now, I'm pretty sure I can handle all of that, but my issue is that the concrete under the door sill is all busted up. It looks like they may have tried to repair it in the past with some sort of combo of spray foam and.. Maybe mortar? I have no idea, but I know it needs to be level before I can replace the subsill, sill, and threshold. From the research I have done I've only seen repairs like this done on slab foundations. This door comes in right at the stairway to my basement, and is a step down from my kitchen. If I just pour some cement on top, it will leak down into the basement below.

739,languages,Some things I like and dislike about English,"I speak multiple languages, and I really enjoy comparing the things that each language is better than all others at.

For example, one thing I really love about English is how you can verb anything. Literally anything. You can say to your friend, ""Beer me,"" and he'll pass you a beer. You can ""google"" questions. You can ""donut it up"" after work at the donut shop. You can ""Gordon Ramsay the hell out of dinner tonight."" Even if you're making up a verb out of a noun and no one has ever spoken like that before, everyone understands what you mean. It only works because of the lack of conjugations at the end of verbs. If you were to try this in, say, Italian, it would be awkward because you'd have to ""google-eare"" something.

Something I feel is lacking from English that most other languages I'm aware of can do, is turn adjectives into nouns. You can't say ""the fat"" or ""that weird"" without tacking on ""guy, man, one"" at the end. That's something that speakers of other languages are CONSTANTLY doing, and it's kind of hard sometimes to find a way around it in English. It can't really be done because of the lack of gender and number indicators at the end of nouns. The only time it's done in English is in  the plural, such as if you're talking about ""the poor"" in society.","Some things I like and dislike about English I speak multiple languages, and I really enjoy comparing the things that each language is better than all others at.

758,languages,Extremely Useful Youtube channel I stumbled upon (For French Learners) ^_^,"Repost from [r/frenchlearners](https://www.reddit.com/r/frenchlearners)

I've been self-learning French for about a year or so and have done my best to up until now to find as many free resources as possible on the internet, of which there are a plethora as i'm sure you already know! It's difficult to really know where to focus ones attention however for that reason, ironically.

About 3/4 months ago whilst browsing french resources on YouTube and language learning channels I came across this channel. A native French/English speaker explaining a variety of topics and providing practical advice.

Logic language learning. \^\_\^

At first sight, I didn't give it much though to be frank, it seemed fairly regular and i wasn't sure if it would be worth the investment in time as i'm already at an intermediate level and not all of the content would be relevant to me like a lot of french teaching channels. (Not saying other channels arent good at what they do, they just do not appeal to my particular needs.) After actually sitting through one of the videos though, i was fairly impressed by how thoroughly he goes through the content and the different approaches he takes to have us not just internalise but comprehend the structures of (What can seem like) endless pages of rules when it come to conjugation of verbs regular and irregular or grammatical structures.

His videos are about 10+ mins on average and he does his best to provide as many examples as possible in order to really solidify the content, all of which can be found (usually) in the information box underneath the video. The only downside would be that you actually need to focus whilst watching his videos, it's more of a discussion and explanation as if you were in the room with him, as opposed to other channels which focus on showing you expressions or key phrases ..where you can skim through and try to extract the key phrases without missing much. Personally i prefer this approach for more complex concepts such as the Subjunctive or Trying to get my head around uses of ""whomever,however, wherever"" etc.

Last but not least, the one thing that i really appreciate about it more so than others, is the fact he makes himself available to answer questions either the comments section, via email or whatsapp which can make all the difference between fully comprehending a concept or the nuances of a topic..

\&gt; so that's part of the reason i decided to go to the effort of posting it on here. In my opinion his content can be extremely useful for others like me and is wroth browsing (there are more than a couple 100 videos) as it covers a variety of topics.

\- He's hosting an interact lesson this weekend and would be worth attending if you have specific questions or what not.

I didn’t get everything he said either. I just froze. I must have come across as one of those rude and ugly foreigners ”.

Has anyone else ever experienced anything similar? 

Luckily, there is nothing to be desperate about! There are painless and efficient ways to avoid such situations and make first (business) encounters successful and enjoyable! Here are some of my tips for learning French, including some productivity hacks!

**Tip number ONE : Set yourself a goal and a time limit** 

You could, for instance, decide to aim for basic oral fluency in French within 6 months, or to learn business French in 3 months, or to master French grammar by the end of the year, etc….To avoid feeling overwhelmed and make the task feel less daunting, it is advised to break the process down into baby steps!

This flexible strategy, which allows you to approach learning French in various ways, also enables you to avoid procrastination, while setting a global framework to track progress. Never forget to celebrate each milestone reached!

**Tip number TWO : Develop a learning routine and dedicate time for learning** 

This implies blocking time slots in your timetable dedicated to learning French, as often and regularly as possible for harmonious progression.

Depending on your goals and on the time limit you have set yourself, your daily routine could, for instance, be based on listening and speaking to enhance your French comprehension and oral skills. For learners in need of written skills, the exercise could be complemented by some reading and writing. 

It is always recommended to seek feedback from a French native speaker, which is definitely nicer than studying alone with books and tapes. After all, languages aren’t about being alone, they are all about sharing, communicating, and coming together!

**Tip number THREE : Define what is motivating you to learn French** 

It doesn't have to be language-related. For instance, your motivation for learning French could be the prospect of visiting every French-speaking country on the planet. Or it could be the prospect of meeting French wine producers touring your home country. Or it could even be love related!

When life gets busy, it is easy to forget what was driving you and justifying the extra effort you’re making. So write it down on a piece of paper and place it somewhere you see it on a daily basis, and most of all, don’t forget to document every little victory and accomplishment, to sustain motivation!

**Tip number FOUR : Focus on learning in context**

For maximal efficiency, it is absolutely crucial to tailor your learning process to your initial goal. This applied learning strategy provides you with both the specific jargon you will need, while also giving you insights on sentence structure. 

Thus, you will learn the very words commonly used by the French in a given context, and how they are used, while skipping totally disconnected and useless vocabulary lists or hard-line grammar lessons.

If your goal isn’t fun-related, - but professional or academic - , alternating goal applied learning and learning according to your favourite interests, can be refreshing!

**TIP number FIVE : Learn some basic language too**

It wouldn’t, however, be true to think that you can survive French language immersion with only contextual or goal-oriented knowledge. Such knowledge always comes wrapped up in current and modern language. Thankfully, we only use a fraction of all the existing words and grammar rules in everyday life.

In terms of vocabulary, defining which 150 words are most used in your native language, getting them translated into French and learning how to pronounce them could be a good start, to supplement your goal-oriented learning process. Then, if you are motivated, you could also consider doing the same in reverse order with French!

Similarly, there's no need to master the wide array of tenses of the French language to get around : the present tense, the ""passé composé""-past tense and a hack concerning the future tense are sufficient for day-to-day life in France!

A fun, quick and painless way to pick up some basic daily life French can be done by speaking French with a native speaker, which leads us to our next tip !

**Tip number SIX : Last but not least : speak, speak, speak**

Do you remember how you picked up your native language? 

We all learnt by repeating what we heard, by imitating grammatical structures and by making tons of mistakes. And we did so by talking. This is how language acquisition works and it should be the first step of any language-learning process. 

Learning how to properly speak a language first, - before diving into grammar and writing – enables people to skip pronunciation problems and to organically acquire the way the language is « sung » with its particular structure. 

This is particularly true with French, the written language of which is quite close to English, but differs greatly in terms of pronunciation. Therefore, focussing on spoken language before even looking at how a language is written is the way to go for efficiency, language fluidity and easier learning afterwards. 

Actually, the vast majority of communication, interactions and transactions between individuals first occurs through spoken language. Some ethnic groups even rely entirely on spoken language and oral tradition. So find an enthusiastic tutor, expat, exchange student, or French foreign teacher and get the chatting going! 

That’s it! You’re all set!

Hope this simple and flexible methodology will help you set the basis for learning French fast and easily, enable you to to impress around you, and get the most out of your stay in France, while avoiding language barrier disasters.

I would love to hear about any remarks or suggestions!","French : I was embarrassed last month, because despite knowing the words, I was unable to form a sentence “ I was embarrassed last month, because despite knowing the words, I was unable to form a sentence in French, in response to the warm welcome I received from the director of the company I was visiting in France.

793,languages,Just........how does this happen?,"Sooooo I'm Maltese. I have NO foreign family members except for like, my great grandfather who was a pale skinned, blond haired, blue eyed Italian from some Northern Italian alps. And he died when I was an infant.

Somehow when I was young I grasped English from TV better than my native language Maltese. My grandparents spoke to me half and half and I purposefully chose English-speaking friends to socialise with at school. But otherwise, most people spoke to me in Maltese, and half the time I'd reply and start conversing with them in English because I've always just felt more comfortable with it.

I understand most Maltese but till this day I still don't understand everything everything and I don't know the words for some specific objects to do with different occupations. Then somehow there are a few, countable words in Maltese where I don't know the English equivelant, if there is one. Whenever I speak Maltese I really have to do the effort and the language doesn't feel natural to me. I sound strained and slow because it's just not natural to me. But worse still is that I have difficulty understanding many elderly people, who have a raspy and low voice due to age or have one of the old Maltese accents (we call it Malti mawweġ or 'twisted Maltese') Yet somehow, whenever I meet American, Irish, Welsh or British tourists on the job, despite the varrying accents they would have I understand them perfectly. Though once I did have an Irish friend where I just couldn't get used to her thick Irish accent. It's amazing how I've watched many news stuffs concerning Ireland, and when they interview random people in the streets I can understand them, but not her. Well she did mention that in Ireland she had a bus driver who spoke Gaelic and not much English, so I suppose she mat be from the very South or something?

Anyways, I don't feel entirely at home in my own native country and it's frustrating :((( I'm constantly in awe of how I I grew more closer to English despite the odds. It does get a bit awkward when people ask about my accent, and I reply that it's not because any of family is foreign, or that I went to a school where lots of kids where foreign, but because I watched too much English TV......","Just........how does this happen?

800,languages,Mom never taught me her native language(s) :/,"So I've always been disappointed by the fact that virtually all my cousins on my mom's side speak 3-4 languages, whereas I speak 1 (2 if you count Mandarin, though I'm not fluent).

My mom's family is Chinese-Indonesian, and they're all from the city of Medan on the island of Sumatra (which has a large Chinese-speaking population). My mom herself speaks 5 languages (Mandarin, Hokkien, Indonesian, English, Cantonese). On top of speaking the local Indonesian, my mom, grandparents, aunts/uncles, and cousins all speak Hokkien, which is a form of Chinese spoken in southern China and among Chinese diasporas in Southeast Asia. It's not mutually intelligible with the Mandarin I was taught, and so I can't even catch any random words whenever they speak Hokkien. I'm the only one of my cousins who was born in the United States (mom studied in the States and married a Taiwanese man there), while all my other cousins were born in Indonesia or Singapore. Since my dad's family doesn't speak Hokkien and only Mandarin, I was only taught Mandarin growing up -- even then, my Mandarin sucks because English basically began to dominate my speech once I started attending a public school (I first attended a private Chinese Christian school in an Asian-majority area, and I moved to a predominantly white area in 3rd grade). Can't read, can't write, and I have a difficult time speaking despite going to Mandarin school for 3 years.

Back to Hokkien: since my relatives all still live in Indonesia, Malaysia, or Singapore (where Hokkien is spoken by some Chinese), they were all taught the language by their parents while also learning Indonesian/Malay for local speech. As I said, Hokkien usage is virtually nonexistent in the States, and therefore I was not taught it, along with Indonesian. Now since neither of my parents are from Mainland China, I've never visited China before in my life. My dad's parents are both deceased, so he hasn't returned to Taiwan since. My mom and I, however, visit Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore every 2 years to see her relatives and parents, who are still alive. And every time I go, I can't help but feel useless and confused whenever every other goddamn relative of mine can fluently speak Hokkien, whereas I cannot understand a single word. They always joke around or share stories with one another in Hokkien, and I'm always the only one left out being the only non-speaker. To make matters worse, I can't speak Indonesian either, and so I need a friend or my mom to translate for me whenever I need to buy something or talk to a local person (it's embarrassing as fuck). I never really have a good time with my family because of this, since every time I try to ask someone to translate their Hokkien speech for me, they all brush me off and ignore me. Sometimes they'll mention my name in their conversations, and I'll just be left hanging and clueless about whatever they're saying about me (to this day, I still personally believe they're gossiping about me because hell, if I spoke a language my family doesn't know -- I actually sort of do, Russian -- I'd do exactly that). And all my cousins also speak English AND Mandarin (so they're all multilingual while I'm semi-bilingual). So yeah, I wish she'd taught me Hokkien or even just the basic conversational aspects. I don't need to be completely fluent -- when am I ever going to use Hokkien in my professional life anyway? -- but I'd at least like to be able to understand if they're talking shit about me.

I'm not motivated to learn Hokkien because it's honestly useless outside of my maternal family circle, and I really just don't want to when there are tons of other major languages I could be devoting my time to. I've tried to learn Indonesian since pronunciation of its words is quite simple (there are no silent letters as in French or Spanish, so all words are spoken almost exactly as they're written), but I don't spend enough time in Indonesia or around Indonesian culture to effectively make progress. And as for Mandarin: I know, I know, it's one of the most useful languages in business and the most spoken language in the world, but I don't have the desire to improve my Mandarin either. I've never really been proud of my Chinese heritage (since 1 in approximately every 5-6 people are Chinese), so it's really just a matter of me trying not to embarrass myself in front of other ABC's or non-Chinese who are better at the language than me. I'm currently learning Russian and a bit of Chechen and Avar, since I plan to study Caucasian languages (as in the Caucasus region of Eurasia), so Mandarin would honestly be useless in my career.

Anyone else have any situations similar to this? I'd totally love to know, because I keep berating myself for a problem that essentially isn't my fault.","Mom never taught me her native language(s) :/ So I've always been disappointed by the fact that virtually all my cousins on my mom's side speak 3-4 languages, whereas I speak 1 (2 if you count Mandarin, though I'm not fluent).

1) The ""R"" is sometimes pronounced different, depending on its position. Let me give an exemple in ""teşekkürler"". Is the R's in the end always pronounced as a lower form of SH? 


2) The letter L has the same problem. I watched a video and there was the word ""değil"", I noticed that the person who was speaking left some strange air coming out, I don't  how to explain. Is that the ""standard"" pronunciation, or it's just a dialect?

826,musictheory,Looking for an explanation of chord inversions in jazz theory,"I'm looking for an explanation – ideally a reference to a book or paper – about the conventions surrounding inversions of chords in jazz played in a solo piano context (with functional harmony around the bebop era; ignore all modal stuff). I've never seen this subject addressed explicitly.

I believe the following is true: Most chords are played in root position, and all lead sheets are interpreted with root position chords unless otherwise notated. For example, just skimming the lead sheet for ""All the things you are"" from a Google search (to take a random example), it looks like a typical realization would probably use 100% root position chords. (I'm thinking of a block chord style such the one on Bill Evans's Solo Sessions; with a walking bassline the question doesn't really make sense.) At the very least, inversions seem much rarer than in classical harmony.

Why is this? Why not smooth the bass line by using inversions? I suppose the rarity might be due to the fact that \~80% of a standard tune is ii-V's, and you want the descending fifth root motion there. But that leaves a handful of changes where using inversions might be useful. Given that jazz is otherwise very harmonically sophisticated, it seems strange it's fairly conservative in this way.

Now, I have seen a few lead sheets which explicitly spell out inversions with slash chords to create step-wise bass lines. Are there any ""rules"" of the (functional, bebop-era) jazz idiom in these situation, or does anything go as long as the bass is cool? Seventh chords with the seventh in the bass? Triads in second inversion that aren't passing, cadential, or pedal (the rules of common-practice harmony)? I feel silly asking this of such a permissive idiom, but I wanted to make sure.

Thanks in advance for the replies. I realize I might have some misconceptions, but I'm asking because I'd like to clear those up.","Looking for an explanation of chord inversions in jazz theory I'm looking for an explanation – ideally a reference to a book or paper – about the conventions surrounding inversions of chords in jazz played in a solo piano context (with functional harmony around the bebop era; ignore all modal stuff).

The part I’m confused about is that if I start with that note and then continue the C minor scale I’m playing A# major aren’t I?

**A)** Those of you that learned the pentatonic first, do you wish you would have started differently by learning the diatonic?

857,musictheory,"Returning to Music Theory as a former Burnout with the Intention of Composing Neoclassical, Ambient, and IDM Music","Hey everyone, 

  
Just wanted to start off with a little history of where I've been and where I'm wanting to go. Buckle up, buttercup, 'cause here we go. There's a TL;DR at the bottom if that's helpful.

  
I took music classes from 3rd grade all the way to 10th grade. That's eight years of piano lessons, one year of violin, and two years of guitar. With every musical instrument I picked up, I found myself very unsatisfied learning to just read and recite sheet music with the intention of performing for others. I wanted to create something, but I was lost and had no idea where to even start, so I quit. During these years, I learned a lot of music theory. I studied for music theory exams and did very well in proctered exams. I learned and created a lot of mnemonics to remember what I needed for the exams. I knew my orders of sharps, flats, the circle of fifths, and could play every scale and chord imaginable on the piano with relative ease. I didn't even have a taste in music back then but I was performing in regional music festivals, ensembles. But therein lied the problem:

***Back then, I studied music theory to get the right answers to pass exams.*** I didn't care much for what I was doing and I finally just crashed and burned with music for a very long time.

Fast forward to 2013: I was wrapping up my first year of college when my parents had me aptitude tested. I discovered that I scored 100% in pitch discrimination, which was incredibly easy for me. It was obvious to me if two pure tones were higher, lower, or the same pitch. That's got to mean something.

A year later, I took MIDI 1 and Audio Engineering 1 courses in college. AE 1 ended up being my favorite college class of all time. I eagerly devoured every lecture and aced every exam. MIDI was incredibly frustrating to me, as I had to compose four songs during the course that demonstrated knowledge of different MIDI concepts. When I sat in front of a piano keyboard, I found myself clueless and lost. Yes, I knew all of the names of the notes and could create any chord and arpeggiate it, but I had no direction for where I wanted to go with my compositions. The pleasantness of the music I created was not the point so I frustratingly hammered out some garbage in C major and did what I needed to do in the DAW I was using to get through the course with an A.

Over the next few years, ***I would approach a piano keyboard full of desire to create something but absolutely lost and frustrated when all I could do is play scales and hammer out chords***.

At the very beginning of 2021, I was gifted a course on music production that began with Andrew Huang's [Learn Music Theory in half an Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0). When all I needed to know in the course was in that little video, I dropped out of the course for a full refund. I had heard about how the basis of music composition was chord progressions and when tasked with looking up chord progressions for songs I liked, I found myself stumped:

***Chord progressions are not published for the music that inspires me.***

I am in love with Ambient, Ambient Techno, IDM, Techno, Electronic, Minimalist, and Neoclassical music. The problem I have is, the artists I love and that I aspire to be like can be rare and only known by eclectics like me, so finding sheet music or chord progressions for their works is impossible.

I can't just look up sheet music or chord progressions for ""[Flat Line/Peak Color"" by Bing &amp; Ruth](https://youtu.be/CsW19ox4_sE), ""[Resin"" by Aes Dana](https://youtu.be/rqY4shbH3LM), ""[More"" by Nils Frahm](https://youtu.be/2B2Vo-lFEas), [""Love"" by Ben Lukas Boysen](https://youtu.be/j7usC68u6kk), or [""Dimensional Scissors Dance Routine"" by Proem](https://youtu.be/2iBfEipdnrI). That stuff just doesn't exist.

The music I am inspired by and I want to create seems to require mastery of composition, extensive experimentation, technical mastery of software, niche hardware, and signal processing, expertise in rhythm and polyrhythm, and extensive audio engineering.

*TL;DR:*

I am confident in my motivation to learn everything I need to learn except relearning the foundations of music: music theory and composition. I have no problems spending hours tweaking knobs on a synthesizer looking for the right timbre and texture in a sound...but if the actual tone and melody beneath that wonderful electronic sound or piano key don't sound right, I find myself getting frustrated and demotivated in a hurry.

862,musictheory,Does anyone else struggle with long-form composing?,"Doesn't necessarily have to be symphonic music or even classical forms in general - it could be prog metal epics, EDM/trance, etc.

I find that I struggle with this the most in my classical/orchestral compositions - I've managed to write only one symphonic movement that's over 10 minutes so far - and it's 10:08 in length. I don't even think I did a great job following/expanding upon sonata form in that movement (I'm quite a war-horse composer and enjoy listening to late Romantic era music for the most part). Basically, the rundown would be as follows (more or less):

Intro | Intro^(I)/Main Theme Transition | Main Theme | Development I | Development II | Recap (Intro Theme/Main Theme Transition) | Main Theme | Coda |**|**

The intro is in F minor (moderate 3/4 rhythm) with a secondary theme in C Major (with a flat 6 modal quality: C D E F G Ab) and a tertiary theme in B-flat minor/F minor that leads to a Half Cadence and right back into a varied (^(I)) version of the intro's main theme. Then there's a brass chorale transition that leads into the F minor main theme (6/8 time and allegro). This ends abruptly with a booming orchestral Half Cadence. The first development ensues in C minor/Major, followed by a refrain of the same development (almost note-for-note) in a transposed F minor/Major. The recapitulation starts with the F minor intro theme and a more filled-out orchestral texture for the transition, then a brief restatement of the main theme followed by an F minor coda.

There's something to this whole movement that doesn't seem to make logical sense as far as the themes go (you'd understand what I mean by listening to it) - for one, the main theme seems to have this ""progression loop"" that I just have to ""kill."" For another, it can be hard to identify which themes are which - it's hard enough for me, **the composer**, just to map out the form of the movement in a coherent and concise way. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere overall and the friggin' *intro* theme is way too repetitive (but there is a reason for that - it's pervasive throughout the symphony, kinda like Dvorak's Ninth). I also don't like that I decided to pad the runtime and try to have an F Major close to the development for the sake of keeping with traditional sonata form (at first, ""Development II"" didn't even exist).

Contrast this with one of my favorite sonata-form movements (and one of my favorite ""motto symphonies"" as well): Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, First Movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Slow Intro (E minor) + Repeat/Transition |

Fast(er) Main Theme Group (E minor) |

Transition (B minor) |

Secondary Theme Group (D Major/minor) |

Development (holy crap he really explores some interesting modulations and tonalities here, especially with some diminished tonalities/dominant transitions) and then: BOOM! D minor chaos, not unlike the development of the first movement of his sixth symphony |

Recapitulation (E minor - Bassoon ushers in the main theme again, and the other winds respond to the call in-kind) || ??? 😮 He modulates to F-sharp minor in the main theme! Beautiful! || Transition^(I) (C-sharp minor, this time) || Secondary Theme Group^(I) (**E Major/minor**) |

Coda (loop closed, rather than developing towards F-sharp minor/G-sharp minor/D-sharp minor/F-sharp Major/minor, and so on), and a nice fade out into oblivion in E minor |**|**

&amp;#x200B;

**He constantly moves around**. Plus the ""math/logic"" behind the development of the modulations back to the E minor recap is brilliant! B minor makes sense as the ""v"" transition between primary and secondary themes (D Major is the relative Major, and changing briefly to the parallel minor of that helps keep it moving forward). And when the recap begins but takes an interesting turn with the F-sharp minor modulation (a whole-step above E minor), we're brought to C-sharp minor this time (a whole-step above B minor), of which the relative major is E major this time (and now the parallel minor thing from earlier makes sense, because this brings us back to the home key). Wow.

And, on top of that, the intro theme is pervasive in various different keys throughout the other movements! (A Major/B diminished in the second movement, A Major with a flat 6 modal quality in the third movement, E Major in the fourth movement), AND the Intro/Main themes arrive together triumphantly in E Major in the finale. Now *that's* how you write a symphony.

To be fair, I am proud of my second, F minor symphony as a whole, but that first movement was kind of a doozy for me to write. Also, I'm struggling with the finale (sixth movement) of a two-part epic program symphony that ideally should be 24 to 30 minutes long when it's finished.

Intro | Intro^(I)/Main Theme Transition | Main Theme | Development I | Development II | Recap (Intro Theme/Main Theme Transition) | Main Theme | Coda |**|**

The intro is in F minor (moderate 3/4 rhythm) with a secondary theme in C Major (with a flat 6 modal quality: C D E F G Ab) and a tertiary theme in B-flat minor/F minor that leads to a Half Cadence and right back into a varied (^(I)) version of the intro's main theme. Then there's a brass chorale transition that leads into the F minor main theme (6/8 time and allegro). This ends abruptly with a booming orchestral Half Cadence. The first development ensues in C minor/Major, followed by a refrain of the same development (almost note-for-note) in a transposed F minor/Major. The recapitulation starts with the F minor intro theme and a more filled-out orchestral texture for the transition, then a brief restatement of the main theme followed by an F minor coda.

There's something to this whole movement that doesn't seem to make logical sense as far as the themes go (you'd understand what I mean by listening to it) - for one, the main theme seems to have this ""progression loop"" that I just have to ""kill."" For another, it can be hard to identify which themes are which - it's hard enough for me, **the composer**, just to map out the form of the movement in a coherent and concise way. It doesn't really seem to go anywhere overall and the friggin' *intro* theme is way too repetitive (but there is a reason for that - it's pervasive throughout the symphony, kinda like Dvorak's Ninth). I also don't like that I decided to pad the runtime and try to have an F Major close to the development for the sake of keeping with traditional sonata form (at first, ""Development II"" didn't even exist).

Contrast this with one of my favorite sonata-form movements (and one of my favorite ""motto symphonies"" as well): Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, First Movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Slow Intro (E minor) + Repeat/Transition |

Fast(er) Main Theme Group (E minor) |

Transition (B minor) |

Secondary Theme Group (D Major/minor) |

Development (holy crap he really explores some interesting modulations and tonalities here, especially with some diminished tonalities/dominant transitions) and then: BOOM! D minor chaos, not unlike the development of the first movement of his sixth symphony |

Recapitulation (E minor - Bassoon ushers in the main theme again, and the other winds respond to the call in-kind) || ??? 😮 He modulates to F-sharp minor in the main theme! Beautiful! || Transition^(I) (C-sharp minor, this time) || Secondary Theme Group^(I) (**E Major/minor**) |

Coda (loop closed, rather than developing towards F-sharp minor/G-sharp minor/D-sharp minor/F-sharp Major/minor, and so on), and a nice fade out into oblivion in E minor |**|**

&amp;#x200B;

**He constantly moves around**. Plus the ""math/logic"" behind the development of the modulations back to the E minor recap is brilliant! B minor makes sense as the ""v"" transition between primary and secondary themes (D Major is the relative Major, and changing briefly to the parallel minor of that helps keep it moving forward). And when the recap begins but takes an interesting turn with the F-sharp minor modulation (a whole-step above E minor), we're brought to C-sharp minor this time (a whole-step above B minor), of which the relative major is E major this time (and now the parallel minor thing from earlier makes sense, because this brings us back to the home key). Wow.

And, on top of that, the intro theme is pervasive in various different keys throughout the other movements! (A Major/B diminished in the second movement, A Major with a flat 6 modal quality in the third movement, E Major in the fourth movement), AND the Intro/Main themes arrive together triumphantly in E Major in the finale. Now *that's* how you write a symphony.

To be fair, I am proud of my second, F minor symphony as a whole, but that first movement was kind of a doozy for me to write. Also, I'm struggling with the finale (sixth movement) of a two-part epic program symphony that ideally should be 24 to 30 minutes long when it's finished.

 I find it similar in a sense to the substituting of a diatonic v in a minor key for a V7 of the parallel major when resolving down to the tonic of a minor key.

892,musictheory,Any programmers here that know about a library for manipulating the frequencies of pitches?,"I've posted on programming subs as well but I think this could be applicable here. Basically, I want to re-construct the already accomplished feat of writing a program that can justly-tune chords on the fly. For example, if I play C4-E4-G4 on a keyboard, I want my program to adjust the frequencies according to the harmonic series instead of playing the equal-tempered version of them. If anyone knows of a library that could do this, I'd greatly appreciate it.","Any programmers here that know about a library for manipulating the frequencies of pitches?

I’ve been playing guitar for 15 years, but I have close to zero knowledge of music theory. Which is mostly fine, I’ve built the ear, intuitionand techniques to play stuff I wanna play, but I’ve been hitting a roadblock more and more often…

When I try to write something, I can come up with 3/4 chords for verse, but most of the time, I have no idea where to take it next to the chorus / bridge si it would just work. It does sometimes, but that’s more of a coincidence, and I’d like to understand what I’m doing.

Another thing is I’d like to try making beats / simple electronic music, but as you can imagine, I don’t know where to start, what chords to pick, how to write melodies to fit the chords etc…

I don’t necceserially need to learn to read music, I want to understand chords, scales, the relationships etc.

908,musictheory,Minor with #4 + #6 AND minor 6th?,"So, this is more about naming octatonic scales, as this is one.

So, if we have a natural minor scale with a raised 4th and a raised 6th we get the Hungarian minor scale (or double harmonic minor scale, whatever floats your boat). Now, if we want to create a scale with both the sixths, it is possible, although rather weird:

The pitch set for this scale is (where C=0 abd C#=1 etc): 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

(= C, D, Eb, F#, G, Ab, A, Bb)

It is messy, especially with 5 notes chromatically next to each other, and before you go stating seven note scale rules, remember that this is an octatonic scale = there will always be a problem in naming the notes by seven note logic. These exist, and there is a wiki article about it, but I am sort of confused by which one you could think of this as.

Cheers!

Ps. I find this hypothetical scale useful when improvising in the Hungarian minor scale: more an improvising tool than a scale you would properly compose in, at least for me.

If you’re someone who can jam bebop, how do you conceptualize it? Do I need to learn all the theory on what notes to choose on an E7b5 or an A13 or should I just transcribe enough to where my ear is sophisticated enough to pick that out in improv? What do I need to study?

I’ve been playing my whole life and can sort of get the sound and I’m feeling frustrated right now Becuase I just have no idea how to approach this style of music.

When I’m playing I’m generally not thinking like “I’m gonna hit this B and do a chromatic walk up to that D” is this how other people think when they play? Like are you playing 16th notes at 140bpm and just saying every note you’re hitting in your head ? (Boy do I have work to do if so)

&gt;In this paper, we attempt to take initial, very preliminary steps towards reverse-engineering transformers.  Given the incredible complexity and size of modern language models, we have found it most fruitful to start with the simplest possible models and work our way up from there.  Our aim is to discover simple algorithmic patterns, motifs, or frameworks that can subsequently be applied to larger and more complex models.  Specifically, in this paper we will study transformers with two layers or less which have only attention blocks – this is in contrast to a large, modern transformer like GPT-3, which has 96 layers and alternates attention blocks with MLP blocks.","[R] A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits [Link to paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html).

920,MachineLearning,[D] Reinforcement Learning with Initial Policy,"Hi guys happy holidays!  So I understand the difference between passive RL and active RL is that in passive RL we’re merely learning the values of the states under a policy we feed the agent, but in active RL, the agent can learn the optimal policy itself.

What’s the best course of action if we have an initial policy we think is good, but we also want to find if there exists a better policy? I thought (approximate) Q-learning might be suitable, where we initialize the Q-states in our policy with values  &gt; 0 and all other Q-states with values = 0, and then set a low epsilon to encourage testing that policy first before increasing it over time to see if there are better policies. However, this seems kind of backwards - because usually we’d want to explore more first, starting from a “blank slate,” and then exploit. Is there another way of going about this? perhaps combining with some form of passive RL?","[D] Reinforcement Learning with Initial Policy Hi guys happy holidays!  So I understand the difference between passive RL and active RL is that in passive RL we’re merely learning the values of the states under a policy we feed the agent, but in active RL, the agent can learn the optimal policy itself.

921,MachineLearning,[P] ClipRCNN: Tiny text-guided zero-shot object detector,"We propose a new tiny architecture of zero-shot object detector inspired by the classical R-CNN object detector, named ClipRCNN. How it works:  
1) First, we should generate region proposals. So, as we need a class agnostic region proposals generator, we chose a classical algorithm named Selective Search instead of any modern pre-trained object detection networks. This step is similar to proposal generation in R-CNN network.  
2) After, we compute CLIP loss between each proposal and all user's prompts (texts and images).  
3) Last, we return top k best proposals (with minimum CLIP loss) as a prediction of the ClipRCNN model.  


This approach isn't perfect at all, but it is really simple and works after writing just a few lines of code.

Aside: I'll just mention an extremely subtle hint about a recent work I remember coming across, but cannot recall its title or other info.

- That work was analyzing residual connections in one of its sections, and commented that a function block with a skip connection was easier to train as it ""only"" has to ***learn the ""domain shift"" from the original (input) data space***. Not sure if they specifically used the words ""domain shift"", but it was close.

- I'd not met this _particular_ framing before that paper. Besides _everything else_ you may want to comment/share here, I'd appreciate if you can comment on or share papers dealing with particular framing as well. **It does not have to come from ML literature. Stats, Math, etc. are also welcome** (with some help to clarify the more jargon-heavy parts).

929,MachineLearning,[D] Since gradient continues to decrease as training loss decreases why do we need to decay the learning rate too?,"This has always bothered me. I will write my question point by point to make myself more clear. 

1. The weight update for SGD is *gradient times learning rate*. 
2. Initially when the training loss is high the gradients are naturally going to be very high. Usually we use high learning rate at this step. 
3. As the training progresses, training loss falls and *gradients also become smaller*. We usually lower the learning rate as the training progresses.
4. So we are reducing the *weight update* through both *learning rate* and *gradient.*
5. Interestingly, for adaptive optimization methods such as ADAM we normalize the gradient by it's second order moments which kind of counteracts the effect of gradients becoming smaller. (I'm not too sure about this though!)
6. So, my question is why do we need to decay the learning rate?","[D] Since gradient continues to decrease as training loss decreases why do we need to decay the learning rate too? This has always bothered me. I will write my question point by point to make myself more clear.

Hi everyone, I just wanted to share a passion project of mine that I've been hacking on and off for a little bit now.  Before you ask ""OP why would you bother creating a DL framework in another programming language? Just use TF/PyTorch/JAX/insert framework here"" - I didn't set out with the (unrealistic) goal of overtaking any existing tooling. I really just enjoy learning more about the internals of modern DL frameworks/algorithms/etc. And I really like Elixir :)

With that said, I am also not here to convince anybody that Elixir or Axon are better than Python and any other existing stack out there. I'm just here to share something that (I think) is cool.

Disclaimers aside, here's a little bit about Axon:

\- Built on top of the Elixir Nx project which supports automatic differentiation and JIT compilation using XLA (HEAVILY modeled after JAX)

\- Keras-like model creation API with support for pretty much anything you can find in a modern framework as well as custom layers for implementing anything you don't already have

\- Optax-inspired optimization API for creating and composing gradient-based optimizers

\- PyTorch Ignite-inspired training/validation/testing API for creating and instrumenting training loops, validation loops, testing, etc.

I'm also actively developing a library on top of Axon which converts to/from ONNX.

The library is still very WIP and there are a lot of features I'm still hacking away at such as multi-device support. But I've found it to be pretty useable for every example I've implemented so far. 

Feedback and questions are always welcome!","[P] Axon: Deep Learning in Elixir Repo: [https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon)

938,MachineLearning,What architectures exist for time series map prediction? [D],"I've been given a problem of generating a map of predicted dust clouds. Imagine you have an n by m grid, and you know the amount of dust in each cell. You also know how much new dust is being produced in each cell. Intuitively, the amount of dust in a cell at time t+1 will depend on the amount of dust in the nearby cells at time t, the amount of dust being produced in nearby cells at time t, and other factor such as wind. For simplicity, lets ignore the win. 

I'm curious what architectures exist for this sort of problem. My initial idea was to have an n by m by 2 input shape, and an n by m by 1 output. The input would be the current dust map in the first layer, and the map of the newly produced dust in the second layer. The output would be the dust map after one time step. In this case, a convolutional autoencoder seems like the simplest solution. This technique is used in [this paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020MS002109).

Very few models for dust exist, so I've been researching weather prediction models, as they are very similar to my problem. I've seen [techniques that use GANs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z.pdf) although the discussions on this forum about it seemed to have some doubts about its effectiveness. 

I've briefly looked at R-CNN methods. I don't think they would be applicable, as they are more for object detection, but feel free to tell me otherwise. 

I've also considered that if my grid is small enough, I could probably get away with not using convolutions at all and could just run it as a straight RNN problem, but that might require a lot more data to converge as its missing the adjacency context the convolutions provide. 

Any ideas are much appreciated.","What architectures exist for time series map prediction? [D] I've been given a problem of generating a map of predicted dust clouds.

946,MachineLearning,[P] Milvus vector database 2.0 is now cloud-scalable,"## Objectives of Milvus vector database

When the idea of the [Milvus vector database](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) first came to our minds, we wanted to build a data infrastructure that could help people accelerate AI adoptions in their organizations.

[Milvus in AI\/ML applications Development Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/ycdqapfjcu681.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceaf1c4002cbb43ca81b0bc9c7e638f4baa6fe31)

We have set two crucial objectives for the Milvus project to fulfill this mission.

### Ease of use

AI/ML is an emerging area where new technologies keep coming out. Most developers are not entirely familiar with the fast-growing technologies and tools of AI. Developers have already consumed most of their energies finding, training, and tuning the models. It's hard for them to spend additional efforts handling the large amounts of embedding vectors generated by the models. Not to mention the manipulation of a large volume of data is always a very challenging task.

Thus we give ""ease of use"" a very high priority since it could significantly reduce the development cost.

### Low running costs

One of the primary hurdles of AI in production is to justify the return of investment. We would have more opportunities to put our AI applications into production with lower running costs. And it would be conducive to lifting the margin of potential benefits.

### Design principles of Milvus 2.0

We made a start towards these goals in Milvus 1.0. But it's far from enough, especially in scalability and availability. Then we started the development of Milvus 2.0 to improve these points. The principles we have laid down for this new version include:

* Aiming for high scalability and availability
* Building upon mature cloud infrastructure and practice
* Minimum performance compromise in the cloud

In other words, we want to make the Milvus database cluster cloud-native.

## The evolution of database clusters

The vector database is a new species of database, as it handles new types of data (vectors). But it still shares the same challenges as other databases, with some of its own requirements. In the rest of this article, I will focus on what we have learned from the existing database cluster implementations and the thinking process of how we designed the new Milvus group architecture.

If you are interested in the implementation details of Milvus group components, please stay on top of the Milvus documentation. We will continuously publish technical articles in the Milvus GitHub repo, Milvus website, and Milvus Blog.

### The ideal database cluster

Let's first list the critical capabilities an **ideal** database cluster should have.

1. Concurrency and no single point of failure: users connected to different group members can simultaneously have read/write access to the same piece of data.
2. Consistency: different group members should see the same data.
3. Scalability: we can add or remove group members on the go.

Honestly, all of these capabilities are hard to acquire together. In the modern implementations of database clusters, people have to compromise some of these capabilities. People don't expect a perfect database cluster as long as it can fit into the user scenarios. However, the shared-everything cluster was once very close to an ideal database cluster. If we want to learn something, we should start from here.

### The key considerations of a database cluster

The shared-everything cluster has a more extended history compared to other modern implementations. Db2 data sharing group and Oracle RAC are typical of shared-everything clusters. Many people think shared-everything means sharing disks. It's far more than that.

A shared-everything cluster only has one kind of database member in the group. Users could connect to any one of these symmetric members to access any data. What is ""everything"" that needs to be shared for making this work?

#### The sequence of events in the group

First, the group event sequence is crucial to resolve the potential conflicts caused by the concurrent access from different groups members. We usually use the database log record sequence number to represent the event sequence. At the same time, the log record sequence number is generally generated from the timestamp.

Thus the requirement of group event sequence is equal to the need of a global timer. If we could have an atomic clock for the group, that would be fabulous. Yet, Milvus is an open-source software project, which means we should rely on commonly available resources. To date, an atomic clock is still a premium option for large companies.

We have implemented the time synchronization component in Milvus 2.0 database cluster. You can find the link in the appendix.

#### Global locking

The database has a locking mechanism to resolve concurrent access conflicts, whether optimistic or pessimistic locks. Similarly, we need global locking to resolve simultaneous access conflicts across different group members.

Global locking means different group members have to talk with each other to negotiate the lock requests. Several vital factors would impact the efficiency of this global lock negotiation process:

* The speed of inter-system connections
* The number of group members who need to participate in the negotiation process
* The frequency of group conflicts

The typical group size is no more than 100. For example, Db2 DSG is 32; Oracle RAC is 100. Those group members will be placed in one server room connected with optical fiber to minimize transfer latency. That's why it is sometimes called a centralized cluster. Due to the group size limitation, people will choose high-end servers (mainframes or minicomputers, which have much more capacity in CPU, memory, I/O channels, etc.) to consist of the shared-everything clusters.

This hardware presumption has dramatically changed in the modern cloud environment. Nowadays, cloud data centers comprise high-dense server rooms full of (thousands of) commodity X86 servers with TCP/IP connections. If we rely on these X86 servers to build the database cluster, the group size should increase to hundreds of (even thousands of) machines. And in some business scenarios, we will want these hundreds of X86 machines to spread in different regions. Thus implementing global locking might not be worth it anymore, as the global locking performance will not be good enough.

In Milvus 2.0, we are not going to implement the global locking facility. On the one hand, there is no update for vector data. (People should rather delete-then-insert instead of update.) So we don't need to worry about the multi-writer conflicts on the same piece of data in the Milvus group with sharding arrangement. Meantime, we could use MVCC (multi-version concurrency control, a lock-avoidance concurrency control method) to resolve the reader-writer conflicts.

On the other hand, vector data processing consumes a much higher memory footprint than structured data processing. People are looking for much higher scalability in vector databases.

#### Shared in-memory data cache

We can briefly divide a database engine into two parts: the storage engine and the computing engine. The storage engine is responsible for two critical tasks:

* Write data to permanent storage for durability purposes.
* Load data from the permanent storage to the in-memory data cache (AKA buffer pool); this is the only place where the computing engine accesses data.

In the database cluster scenario, what if member A has updated the data cached in member B? How could member B know its in-memory data is expired? The classic shared-everything cluster has a buffer cross invalidation mechanism to resolve this issue. The buffer cross invalidation mechanism will work similarly to global locking if we maintain a strong consistency across the group members. As stated before, it is not practical in the modern cloud environment. **So we decided to lower the consistency level in the Milvus cloud-scalable group to an eventual consistency manner.** In this way, the buffer cross invalidation mechanism in Milvus 2.0 can be an asynchronous process.

#### Shared storage

Shared storage is probably the first thing people would think about when discussing a database cluster.

Storage options have also significantly changed in recent years of cloud storage evolution. The storage attached network (SAN) was (and still is) the storage foundation of the shared-everything group. But in the cloud environment, there is no SAN. The database has to use the local disk attached to the cloud virtual machines. Using local disk introduces the challenge of data consistency across the group members. And we also have to worry about the high availability of the group members.

Then Snowflake made a great role model for cloud databases using cloud shared storage (S3 storage). It inspires Milvus 2.0 too. As stated before, we intend to rely on mature cloud infrastructure. But before we could utilize cloud shared storage, we have to think about a couple of things.

First, S3 storage is cheap and reliable, but it is not designed for instant r/W access like database scenarios. We need to create the data components (which we call data nodes in Milvus 2.0) to bridge the local memory/disk and S3 storage. There are some examples (like Alluxio, JuiceFS, etc.) we could learn. The reason we can not integrate these projects directly is we focus on different data granularity. Alluxio and JuiceFS are designed for datasets or POSIX files, while we focus on the data record (vector) level.

When the vector data is settled on S3 storage, the answer for metadata is easy: store them in ETCD. How about the log data, then? In the classic implementations, the log store is also based on SAN. The log files of one database group member are shared within the database cluster for failure recovery purposes. So this was not a problem until we got into the cloud environment.

In the Spanner paper, Google illustrated how they implemented the globally-distributed database (group) with Paxos consensus algorithm. You need to program the database cluster as a state machine replication group. The redo log is usually the ""state"" that will be replicated across the group.

Redo-log replication by consensus algorithms is a powerful tool, and it has substantial advantages in some business scenarios. But for the Milvus vector database, we don't find enough incentives for creating a state machine replication group as a whole. We decided to use the cloud messaging queue/platform (Apache Pulsar, Apache Kafka, etc.) as an alternative cloud shared storage for the log store. By delegating the log store to the messaging platform, we acquire the benefits below.

* The group is more event-driven, which means many processes can be asynchronous. It improves scalability.
* The components are more loosely coupled, making it much easier to perform online rolling upgrades. It improves availability and operability.

We will revisit this topic in the later section.

So far, we have wrapped up the crucial considerations of the database cluster. Before we can jump to the discussion on the Milvus 2.0 architecture, let me first explain how we manage vectors in Milvus.

### Data management and performance predictability

Milvus stores vectors in collections. The ""collection"" is a logical concept, equivalent to a ""table"" in SQL databases. A ""collection"" could have multiple physical files to keep vectors. A physical file is a ""segment"". The ""segment"" is a physical concept like a tablespace file in SQL databases. When the data volume is small, we can save everything in a single segment/physical file. But nowadays, we are constantly facing big data. When there are multiple segments/physical files, how should we spread the data in different data partitions?

Although data comes first rather than indexes, we have to store data in the way that the index algorithm prefers to make the data access efficiently in most cases. A frequently used strategy in SQL databases is partition by the range of partitioning key values. People usually create a clustered index to enforce the partitioning key. Overall, this is a decent approach for SQL databases. Data is stored in good shape, optimized for I/O (prefetch). But there are still defects.

* Data skew. Some of the partitions might have much more data than others. The distribution of real-world data is not as simple as the numeric range.
* Access hotspots. More workload might go to some of the data partitions.

Imagine more workload goes to partitions with more data. We need to rebalance the data across the partitions when these situations occur. (This is a DBA's tedious daily life.)

[The Clustered index for vectors](https://preview.redd.it/uhgtqzducu681.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b35c68716670106daf662251cd326e0538b03f4)

We can also create a clustered index for vectors (an inverted list index). But that is not the same case as SQL databases. Once the index is built in SQL databases, it's very efficient to access the data through the index, with less computation and less I/O operations. But for vector data, there will be far more computation and I/O operations even with an index. So the defects mentioned before will have a more severe impact on vector database clusters. Moreover, the cost of rebalancing vectors across different segments is very high due to the data volume and computing complexity.

In Milvus, we use the strategy of partition by growth. When we inject data into a vector collection, Milvus will append the new vectors to the latest segment in the collection. Milvus will close the segment once its size is large enough (the threshold is configurable) and build the index for the closed segment. In the meantime, a new segment will be created to store the upcoming data. This simple strategy is more balanced for vector processing.

The vector query is a process to search for the most similar candidates in the vector collection. It is a typical MapReduce procedure. For example, we want to search the top 20 similar results from a vector collection with ten segments. We can search the top 20 on each one of the segments and then merge the 20 \* 10 results into the final 20 results. Since each segment has the same amount of vectors and a similar index, the processing time on each segment is almost identical. It gives us the advantage of performance predictability, which is essential when planning the scale of the database clusters.

### New paradigms in Milvus 2.0

In Milvus 1.0, we implemented a read/write splitting sharding group like most SQL databases. It was a good attempt at scaling the Milvus database cluster. But the problems are quite obvious too.

[Milvus 1.0: sharding cluster](https://preview.redd.it/yc51oizzcu681.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccd186df0d97eba91c2d8568fbf4ae19ea1902f9)

In Milvus 1.0, the r/W node has to take total care of the latest segment, including vector appending, searching in this unindexed segment, building index, etc. Since each collection only has one writer, the writer is very busy if the data is continuously streamed into the system. The performance of data sharing between the r/W node and the reader nodes is also a problem. Besides, we must either rely on NFS (not stable) or premium cloud storage (too expensive) for shared data storage.

These existing problems are hard to tackle in the Milvus 1.0 architecture. Thus, we have introduced new paradigms into the Milvus 2.0 design to resolve these issues.

[Milvus 2.0: cloud-scalable vector database](https://preview.redd.it/wveh4vj4du681.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb203a8b1498836f01207f44a963b5d2d76bddcb)

#### Actor model

There are two models to program concurrent computation systems.

* Shared memory that means concurrency control (locking) and synchronous processing
* The actor model (AKA message passing) means message-driven and asynchronous processing

We can also apply these two models in distributed database clusters.

As stated before, most high-profile distributed databases use the same method: redo-log replication by consensus algorithms. This is synchronous processing using consensus algorithms to build a distributed shared memory for redo-log records. Different companies and venture capitals have invested billions of bucks in this technology. I didn't want to comment on this until we started to work on Milvus 2.0. Many people regard this technology as the only way to realize distributed database systems. This is annoying. If I don't say something, people might misunderstand that we were reckless in distributed database design.

In recent years, Redo-log replication by consensus algorithms has been the most overestimated database technology. There are two key issues.

* The presumption that redo-log replication is better is fragile.
* Vendors mislead people's expectations on the capability of consensus algorithms.

Let's say we have two database nodes, the source node, and the target node. In the ever beginning, they have the exact copy of the data. We have some change operations (I/U/D SQL statements) on the source node, and we want to keep the target node updated. What should we do? The simplest way is to replay the operations on the target node. But this is not the most efficient way.

Thinking about the running cost of an I/U/D statement, we can divide it into the execution preparation and the physical work parts. The execution preparation part includes the work of SQL parser, SQL optimizer, etc. No matter how many data records will be affected, it is a fixed cost. The cost of the physical work part depends on how many data records will be affected; it is a floating cost. The idea behind redo-log replication is to save the fixed cost on the target node; we only replay the redo-log (the physical work) on the target node.

The cost-saving percentage is the reciprocal of the number of redo-log records. If one operation only affects one record, I should see significant savings from redo-log replication. What if it's 10,000 records? Then we should worry about the network reliability. Which one is more reliable, send the one operation or the 10,000 redo-log records? How about one million records? Redo-log replication is super in scenarios like payment systems, metadata systems, etc. In these scenarios, each database I/U/D operation only affects a small number of records (1 or 2). But it's hard to work with I/O intensive workloads like batch jobs.

Vendors always claim consensus algorithms could provide strong consistency to the database clusters. But people only use consensus algorithms to replicate the redo-log records. The redo-log records are consistent on different nodes, but that doesn't mean the data views on other nodes are consistent either. We have to merge the redo-log records into the actual table records. So even with this synchronous processing, we can still only get eventual consistency on the data views.

We should use redo-log replication by consensus algorithms in the appropriate places. The metadata system (ETCD) and messaging platform (e.g., Apache Pulsar) used in Milvus 2.0 have implemented consensus algorithms. But as I said before, ""for the Milvus vector database, we don't find enough incentives for being a state machine replication group as a whole.""

In Milvus 2.0, we use the actor model to organize the worker nodes. The worker nodes are lonely. They only talk to the messaging platform, getting commands and sending results. It sounds boring.

The actor model is asynchronous. It is suitable for scalability and availability. Since the worker nodes don't know each other, there is no impact on other worker nodes if some of the worker nodes join or are removed.

#### Separation of availability and durability

In Milvus 2.0, we do operation replay rather than log replay, because in the vector database, there is not much difference between operation replay and log replay. We don't have the Update function nor the Insert with Select function. And it's also much easier to do operation replay with the actor model.

So multiple worker nodes might execute the same operation from the messaging platform according to their responsibility. I mentioned before we decided to use the S3 cloud storage as the shared storage layer of the Milvus database cluster. The S3 storage is very reliable. Then is it necessary for different worker nodes to write out the same data to the shared storage?

Thus we designed three roles for the worker nodes.

* The query node maintains an in-memory data view according to the assignment. The work of the query node includes doing vector search and keeping the in-memory data updated. But it doesn't need to write anything to the S3 storage. It is the most memory-sensitive node in the group.
* The data node is responsible for writing the new data to the S3 storage. The data node doesn't need to maintain the in-memory data view, so the hardware configuration of the data node is quite different from the query node.
* The index node builds indexes for the segments closed by the data node when the size of the segments reaches the threshold. This is the most CPU-intensive work in the group.

These three types of nodes represent different kinds of workload. They can scale independently. We call it separation of availability and durability learned from the Microsoft Socrates cloud database.","[P] Milvus vector database 2.0 is now cloud-scalable ## Objectives of Milvus vector database

In the rest of this article, I will focus on what we have learned from the existing database cluster implementations and the thinking process of how we designed the new Milvus group architecture.

If you are interested in the implementation details of Milvus group components, please stay on top of the Milvus documentation. We will continuously publish technical articles in the Milvus GitHub repo, Milvus website, and Milvus Blog.

### The ideal database cluster

Let's first list the critical capabilities an **ideal** database cluster should have.

1. Concurrency and no single point of failure: users connected to different group members can simultaneously have read/write access to the same piece of data.
2. Consistency: different group members should see the same data.
3. Scalability: we can add or remove group members on the go.

Honestly, all of these capabilities are hard to acquire together. In the modern implementations of database clusters, people have to compromise some of these capabilities. People don't expect a perfect database cluster as long as it can fit into the user scenarios. However, the shared-everything cluster was once very close to an ideal database cluster. If we want to learn something, we should start from here.

### The key considerations of a database cluster

The shared-everything cluster has a more extended history compared to other modern implementations. Db2 data sharing group and Oracle RAC are typical of shared-everything clusters. Many people think shared-everything means sharing disks. It's far more than that.

A shared-everything cluster only has one kind of database member in the group. Users could connect to any one of these symmetric members to access any data. What is ""everything"" that needs to be shared for making this work?

#### The sequence of events in the group

First, the group event sequence is crucial to resolve the potential conflicts caused by the concurrent access from different groups members. We usually use the database log record sequence number to represent the event sequence. At the same time, the log record sequence number is generally generated from the timestamp.

Thus the requirement of group event sequence is equal to the need of a global timer. If we could have an atomic clock for the group, that would be fabulous. Yet, Milvus is an open-source software project, which means we should rely on commonly available resources. To date, an atomic clock is still a premium option for large companies.

We have implemented the time synchronization component in Milvus 2.0 database cluster. You can find the link in the appendix.

#### Global locking

The database has a locking mechanism to resolve concurrent access conflicts, whether optimistic or pessimistic locks. Similarly, we need global locking to resolve simultaneous access conflicts across different group members.

Global locking means different group members have to talk with each other to negotiate the lock requests. Several vital factors would impact the efficiency of this global lock negotiation process:

* The speed of inter-system connections
* The number of group members who need to participate in the negotiation process
* The frequency of group conflicts

The typical group size is no more than 100. For example, Db2 DSG is 32; Oracle RAC is 100. Those group members will be placed in one server room connected with optical fiber to minimize transfer latency. That's why it is sometimes called a centralized cluster. Due to the group size limitation, people will choose high-end servers (mainframes or minicomputers, which have much more capacity in CPU, memory, I/O channels, etc.) to consist of the shared-everything clusters.

This hardware presumption has dramatically changed in the modern cloud environment. Nowadays, cloud data centers comprise high-dense server rooms full of (thousands of) commodity X86 servers with TCP/IP connections. If we rely on these X86 servers to build the database cluster, the group size should increase to hundreds of (even thousands of) machines. And in some business scenarios, we will want these hundreds of X86 machines to spread in different regions. Thus implementing global locking might not be worth it anymore, as the global locking performance will not be good enough.

In Milvus 2.0, we are not going to implement the global locking facility. On the one hand, there is no update for vector data. (People should rather delete-then-insert instead of update.) So we don't need to worry about the multi-writer conflicts on the same piece of data in the Milvus group with sharding arrangement. Meantime, we could use MVCC (multi-version concurrency control, a lock-avoidance concurrency control method) to resolve the reader-writer conflicts.

On the other hand, vector data processing consumes a much higher memory footprint than structured data processing. People are looking for much higher scalability in vector databases.

#### Shared in-memory data cache

We can briefly divide a database engine into two parts: the storage engine and the computing engine. The storage engine is responsible for two critical tasks:

* Write data to permanent storage for durability purposes.
* Load data from the permanent storage to the in-memory data cache (AKA buffer pool); this is the only place where the computing engine accesses data.

In the database cluster scenario, what if member A has updated the data cached in member B? How could member B know its in-memory data is expired? The classic shared-everything cluster has a buffer cross invalidation mechanism to resolve this issue. The buffer cross invalidation mechanism will work similarly to global locking if we maintain a strong consistency across the group members. As stated before, it is not practical in the modern cloud environment. **So we decided to lower the consistency level in the Milvus cloud-scalable group to an eventual consistency manner.** In this way, the buffer cross invalidation mechanism in Milvus 2.0 can be an asynchronous process.

#### Shared storage

Shared storage is probably the first thing people would think about when discussing a database cluster.

Storage options have also significantly changed in recent years of cloud storage evolution. The storage attached network (SAN) was (and still is) the storage foundation of the shared-everything group. But in the cloud environment, there is no SAN. The database has to use the local disk attached to the cloud virtual machines. Using local disk introduces the challenge of data consistency across the group members. And we also have to worry about the high availability of the group members.

Then Snowflake made a great role model for cloud databases using cloud shared storage (S3 storage). It inspires Milvus 2.0 too. As stated before, we intend to rely on mature cloud infrastructure. But before we could utilize cloud shared storage, we have to think about a couple of things.

The reason we can not integrate these projects directly is we focus on different data granularity. Alluxio and JuiceFS are designed for datasets or POSIX files, while we focus on the data record (vector) level.

When the vector data is settled on S3 storage, the answer for metadata is easy: store them in ETCD. How about the log data, then? In the classic implementations, the log store is also based on SAN. The log files of one database group member are shared within the database cluster for failure recovery purposes. So this was not a problem until we got into the cloud environment.

By delegating the log store to the messaging platform, we acquire the benefits below.

* The group is more event-driven, which means many processes can be asynchronous. It improves scalability.
* The components are more loosely coupled, making it much easier to perform online rolling upgrades. It improves availability and operability.

We will revisit this topic in the later section.

So far, we have wrapped up the crucial considerations of the database cluster. Before we can jump to the discussion on the Milvus 2.0 architecture, let me first explain how we manage vectors in Milvus.

### Data management and performance predictability

Milvus stores vectors in collections. The ""collection"" is a logical concept, equivalent to a ""table"" in SQL databases. A ""collection"" could have multiple physical files to keep vectors. A physical file is a ""segment"". The ""segment"" is a physical concept like a tablespace file in SQL databases. When the data volume is small, we can save everything in a single segment/physical file. But nowadays, we are constantly facing big data. When there are multiple segments/physical files, how should we spread the data in different data partitions?

Although data comes first rather than indexes, we have to store data in the way that the index algorithm prefers to make the data access efficiently in most cases. A frequently used strategy in SQL databases is partition by the range of partitioning key values. People usually create a clustered index to enforce the partitioning key. Overall, this is a decent approach for SQL databases. Data is stored in good shape, optimized for I/O (prefetch). But there are still defects.

* Data skew. Some of the partitions might have much more data than others. The distribution of real-world data is not as simple as the numeric range.
* Access hotspots. More workload might go to some of the data partitions.

Imagine more workload goes to partitions with more data. We need to rebalance the data across the partitions when these situations occur. (This is a DBA's tedious daily life.)

[The Clustered index for vectors](https://preview.redd.it/uhgtqzducu681.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b35c68716670106daf662251cd326e0538b03f4)

We can also create a clustered index for vectors (an inverted list index). But that is not the same case as SQL databases. Once the index is built in SQL databases, it's very efficient to access the data through the index, with less computation and less I/O operations. But for vector data, there will be far more computation and I/O operations even with an index. So the defects mentioned before will have a more severe impact on vector database clusters. Moreover, the cost of rebalancing vectors across different segments is very high due to the data volume and computing complexity.

In Milvus, we use the strategy of partition by growth. When we inject data into a vector collection, Milvus will append the new vectors to the latest segment in the collection. Milvus will close the segment once its size is large enough (the threshold is configurable) and build the index for the closed segment. In the meantime, a new segment will be created to store the upcoming data. This simple strategy is more balanced for vector processing.

The vector query is a process to search for the most similar candidates in the vector collection. It is a typical MapReduce procedure. For example, we want to search the top 20 similar results from a vector collection with ten segments. We can search the top 20 on each one of the segments and then merge the 20 \* 10 results into the final 20 results. Since each segment has the same amount of vectors and a similar index, the processing time on each segment is almost identical. It gives us the advantage of performance predictability, which is essential when planning the scale of the database clusters.

### New paradigms in Milvus 2.0

In Milvus 1.0, we implemented a read/write splitting sharding group like most SQL databases. It was a good attempt at scaling the Milvus database cluster. But the problems are quite obvious too.

[Milvus 1.0: sharding cluster](https://preview.redd.it/yc51oizzcu681.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccd186df0d97eba91c2d8568fbf4ae19ea1902f9)

In Milvus 1.0, the r/W node has to take total care of the latest segment, including vector appending, searching in this unindexed segment, building index, etc. Since each collection only has one writer, the writer is very busy if the data is continuously streamed into the system. The performance of data sharing between the r/W node and the reader nodes is also a problem. Besides, we must either rely on NFS (not stable) or premium cloud storage (too expensive) for shared data storage.

These existing problems are hard to tackle in the Milvus 1.0 architecture. Thus, we have introduced new paradigms into the Milvus 2.0 design to resolve these issues.

[Milvus 2.0: cloud-scalable vector database](https://preview.redd.it/wveh4vj4du681.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb203a8b1498836f01207f44a963b5d2d76bddcb)

#### Actor model

There are two models to program concurrent computation systems.

* Shared memory that means concurrency control (locking) and synchronous processing
* The actor model (AKA message passing) means message-driven and asynchronous processing

We can also apply these two models in distributed database clusters.

As stated before, most high-profile distributed databases use the same method: redo-log replication by consensus algorithms. This is synchronous processing using consensus algorithms to build a distributed shared memory for redo-log records. Different companies and venture capitals have invested billions of bucks in this technology. I didn't want to comment on this until we started to work on Milvus 2.0. Many people regard this technology as the only way to realize distributed database systems. This is annoying. If I don't say something, people might misunderstand that we were reckless in distributed database design.

In recent years, Redo-log replication by consensus algorithms has been the most overestimated database technology. There are two key issues.

* The presumption that redo-log replication is better is fragile.
* Vendors mislead people's expectations on the capability of consensus algorithms.

Let's say we have two database nodes, the source node, and the target node. In the ever beginning, they have the exact copy of the data. We have some change operations (I/U/D SQL statements) on the source node, and we want to keep the target node updated. What should we do? The simplest way is to replay the operations on the target node. But this is not the most efficient way.

Thinking about the running cost of an I/U/D statement, we can divide it into the execution preparation and the physical work parts. The execution preparation part includes the work of SQL parser, SQL optimizer, etc. No matter how many data records will be affected, it is a fixed cost. The cost of the physical work part depends on how many data records will be affected; it is a floating cost. The idea behind redo-log replication is to save the fixed cost on the target node; we only replay the redo-log (the physical work) on the target node.

The cost-saving percentage is the reciprocal of the number of redo-log records. If one operation only affects one record, I should see significant savings from redo-log replication. What if it's 10,000 records? Then we should worry about the network reliability. Which one is more reliable, send the one operation or the 10,000 redo-log records? How about one million records? Redo-log replication is super in scenarios like payment systems, metadata systems, etc. In these scenarios, each database I/U/D operation only affects a small number of records (1 or 2). But it's hard to work with I/O intensive workloads like batch jobs.

Vendors always claim consensus algorithms could provide strong consistency to the database clusters. But people only use consensus algorithms to replicate the redo-log records. The redo-log records are consistent on different nodes, but that doesn't mean the data views on other nodes are consistent either. We have to merge the redo-log records into the actual table records. So even with this synchronous processing, we can still only get eventual consistency on the data views.

We should use redo-log replication by consensus algorithms in the appropriate places. The metadata system (ETCD) and messaging platform (e.g., Apache Pulsar) used in Milvus 2.0 have implemented consensus algorithms. But as I said before, ""for the Milvus vector database, we don't find enough incentives for being a state machine replication group as a whole.""

In Milvus 2.0, we use the actor model to organize the worker nodes. The worker nodes are lonely. They only talk to the messaging platform, getting commands and sending results. It sounds boring.

The actor model is asynchronous. It is suitable for scalability and availability. Since the worker nodes don't know each other, there is no impact on other worker nodes if some of the worker nodes join or are removed.

#### Separation of availability and durability

In Milvus 2.0, we do operation replay rather than log replay, because in the vector database, there is not much difference between operation replay and log replay. We don't have the Update function nor the Insert with Select function. And it's also much easier to do operation replay with the actor model.

So multiple worker nodes might execute the same operation from the messaging platform according to their responsibility. I mentioned before we decided to use the S3 cloud storage as the shared storage layer of the Milvus database cluster. The S3 storage is very reliable. Then is it necessary for different worker nodes to write out the same data to the shared storage?

Thus we designed three roles for the worker nodes.

* The query node maintains an in-memory data view according to the assignment. The work of the query node includes doing vector search and keeping the in-memory data updated. But it doesn't need to write anything to the S3 storage. It is the most memory-sensitive node in the group.
* The data node is responsible for writing the new data to the S3 storage. The data node doesn't need to maintain the in-memory data view, so the hardware configuration of the data node is quite different from the query node.
* The index node builds indexes for the segments closed by the data node when the size of the segments reaches the threshold. This is the most CPU-intensive work in the group.

These three types of nodes represent different kinds of workload. They can scale independently. We call it separation of availability and durability learned from the Microsoft Socrates cloud database."

(newby to the group here), I was wondering if you would mind elaborating on potential demand for ML operations collaboration with data analytics departments and data scientists?  When I first started in data science the last thing I  wanted to do was integrate with APIs and perform ETL, clean and format data into feature sets, and manage models.  I had the most fun calculating interesting statistical reports and building and running simulations.  I'm wondering if with today's data science landscape and tools available folks are still feeling that problem?  If the problem exists how are folks handling it, particularly when building production capabilities from the research and models?

A  little background if you are interested... I started developing over 20 years ago because of an interest in data science (particularly in finance and economics), multi agent systems, and machine learning (in Lisp at the time), but my career (application and hosting platform engineering and architecture) took me away from that objective, and I gradually became unhappy with what I was building and managing.  I made a choice to get back to that passion and I started working on a platform to do the underlying plumbing of managing cloud infrastructure and data integration and processing, so I  personally could create multi agent simulators and self optimizing recommendation engines.  But admittedly I am behind on my knowledge about what is really going on in the data science market.

My best models so far never predict the minority class: 1, giving me 95% accuracy. But, I'm lost as to how I can make this higher given that these models are only performing as well as a naive model which just predicts 0 all of the time.

Should my training set include more of the minority class (e.g. do SMOTE, up/down sampling) even if the model will only ultimately be evaluated on a similarly skewed test set? Should I be using a different model (currently Logistic Regression and Random Forest work best)? Should my model instead output probabilities for which I can set a threshold myself to make predictions (any resources on this)?

I'm working on building a binary classification model on an imbalanced (95% majority class: 0) dataset. The model will ultimately only be evaluated on a similarly imbalanced test set for which the only goal is highest overall accuracy (even though I understand one typically shouldn't use accuracy for evaluation on an imbalanced dataset).

My best models so far never predict the minority class: 1, giving me 95% accuracy. But, I'm lost as to how I can make this higher given that these models are only performing as well as a naive model which just predicts 0 all of the time.

Should my training set include more of the minority class (e.g. do SMOTE, up/down sampling) even if the model will only ultimately be evaluated on a similarly skewed test set? Should I be using a different model (currently Logistic Regression and Random Forest work best)? Should my model instead output probabilities for which I can set a threshold myself to make predictions (any resources on this)? Is there a way in Python to change the loss function to punish the model for getting the minority class wrong?"

960,MachineLearning,[D] Hyperparameter Optimization for Noise Robustness,"Imagine you propose a novel method that claims to be more robust towards label noise, e.g., in a classification setting, in the sense that its generalization performance does not suffer as much as other methods do when facing increasing degrees of noise.

However, many studies miss a proper hyperparameter optimization to conduct somewhat fair comparisons (or they do not report the way they optimized the parameters in depth). Often, it does not become clear to me whether the validation data (think of e.g., single train-/val-splits - employing a cross-validation makes it even less obvious) is assumed to have the same noise as the training data or being a ""cleaner"" representative of the test data distribution.

I  lost my hard drive some months ago and with it a book whose table of contents I recall liking.I was looking forward to read it. But now, I can't find it!

This is what I remember:

The book is written by a mathematician, it was a hefty volume (at least 800-900 pages) and it was about the mathematics of machine learning or deep learning (tbh I dont remember which one) but it is possible it was not titled that way because I havent been able to find it using those terms and you know how mathematicians are (""Elements of analysis and algebra in the study of universal approximators""???)

As noted in the title it was posted to the arxiv, it had not been published as far as I recall. It is the kind of book senior professors write summarizing lots of stuff.

The book was rigorous, I think it starts all the way back to analysis or even set theory and spends like 500 pages before ""touching ground""

The author is a French mathematician I think, although based in the US

I know the link for the book has been posted here and also in Hacker News.

Obvious notes:

No, the professor is not Mr LeCun

No, the book is not MML or the Bengio et al one

I have been racking my brain all day and nothing. Maybe one of you guys can provide relief.

I reserve the right to be wrong in some of the details, you know the brain is a tricky bastard.

From my understanding, the icing on the cake paper claims higher accuracy by saving the feature maps generated by convolution layers before the classifier layer during training , and using them to retrain just the classifier (fully connected layers) again.

The authors comment they have no idea why. I hypothesize that (assuming the classifier training feature maps are given the same order as original training) because the feature maps from early in training are very poor (CNN not trained and bad at extracting features)  they actually act as a regularization method for the classifier. Then  the much better feature maps from the end of original training re converges the classifier to a slightly different point in the loss landscape. This seems to be similar to layer wise regularization through noise injection perhaps?

LaMa is a system that is amazing at removing foreground objects from images, especially when those objects cover a large part of the image itself. LaMa is specifically trained to reconstruct large masked areas and includes global information throughout its forward propagation by using Fourier Convolutions in its layers. This makes it incredibly effective at reconstructing periodic structures with long-range consistency, compared to regular convolutions.

This is accomplished  by two batching  routines, which keeps the process inside vectorized operations as often as it can. There is also some intelligent numpy slicing involved.

[https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/fastshap](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/fastshap)

On   the Boston dataset, using all 506 rows as a background set, this runs   in about 26 seconds. The original shap package (KernelExplainer) takes   about 11 minutes. This difference grows more pronounced with larger   datasets.

A few notes:

1. This  package was really designed to be used on tabular data, as of now  features can't be grouped, i.e. no superpixels. This feature will be  added in the near future, though.
2. Only a kernel explainer is implemented, which calculates shap values for any arbitrary model. Model specific methods (i.e. TreeExplainer) are still much faster.
3. Can automatically handle pandas DataFrames or numpy arrays
4. Background dataset stratifying methods are available.
5. Can only calculate shap values for 1 dimensional outputs as of now (n dimensions coming soon)
6. The linear model, from which we get the shap values from the coefficients, can be any of the models from the sklearn.linear\_model module.

This is available now on pypi, coming soon to conda-forge.","[Project] Introducing fastshap, for quick (kernel) model explanations.

I have been working on this project for over a month now. However, I couldn’t make it work yet. So, I need help.

It is basically applying the [probabilistic UNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05034.pdf) paper on the leaf segmentation dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

 

The architecture has two loss components; the KL divergence and reconstruction loss. When I train it, the KL loss goes to zero, however the reconstruction loss works differently that what I want.

 What actually happens is that the noise is ignored it acts like a semantic segmentation. Basically, the RGB image and the different instances are mapped to the same latent space.

**Summary**

Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advance in artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular toward the goal of human-like artificial general intelligence (AGI). It’s sometimes claimed, though, that machine learning is “just statistics”, hence that progress in AI is illusory with regard to this grander ambition. Here I take the contrary view that LLMs have a great deal to teach us about the nature of language, understanding, intelligence, sociality, and personhood. Specifically: statistics do amount to understanding, in any falsifiable sense. Furthermore, much of what we consider intelligence is inherently dialogic, hence social; it requires a theory of mind. Since the interior state of another being can only be understood through interaction, no objective answer is possible to the question of when an “it” becomes a “who” — but for many people, neural nets running on computers are likely to cross this threshold in the very near future.

one could think of such a problem in a more ""mathematical"" form -  suppose our robot can be represented by some function R (unknown to us), such that R(I)=y. our goal would be to find arg-max R(I).

I personally need it for RAW files (CR2, DNG, etc), as part of a larger project. Specifically this is to recover/rebuild detail and remove digital noise artifacts and streaking when images are underexposed in DSLRs. 

If nothing like this exists that supports CPU, perhaps you may know of some libraries that could help in building something like this—aside from the usual opencv, numpy, etc—or perhaps some resources on modifying CUDA scripts to function using CPU (such as for pytorch).

1010,MachineLearning,[R] Understanding AlphaZero Neural Network’s SuperHuman Chess Ability (Summary of the Paper 'Acquisition of Chess Knowledge in AlphaZero'),"As a common and (sometimes) proven belief, deep learning systems seem to learn uninterpretable representations and are far from human understanding. Recently, some studies have highlighted the fact that this may not always be applicable, and some networks may be able to learn human-readable representations. Unfortunately, this ability could merely come from the fact that these networks are exposed to human-generated data. So, to demonstrate their ability to learn like humans (and not that they are simply memorizing human-created labels), it is necessary to test them without any label. 

Following this idea, [the DeepMind and Google Brain teams, together with the 14th world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, studied](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09259.pdf) [their creature AlphaZero from this point of view](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09259.pdf). AlphaZero is the descendant of AlphaGo, the super neural network that beat the world champion Lee Sedol in a best-of-five GO match, a turning point in the history of deep learning, as can also be seen in the wonderful Netflix documentary *AlphaGo*. 

Unlike AlphaGo, AlphaZero is trained through self-play (i.e., it learns to play competing against itself) and masters not only GO but also chess and shogi. This trait makes AlphaZero the perfect case study to explore this idea. Moreover, given the fact that it performs at a superhuman level, understanding its functionality is also particularly useful for highlighting unknown patterns which have never been discovered by chess theorists.

Early approaches easily handled small graphs with a few thousand nodes but scaled poorly to large graphs with millions of nodes. Several approaches have been proposed for scaling GNNs to large graphs. We recently published an overview of a few core approaches for GNN scalability.

One advantage the anki brings to me is that now I can choose what knowledge I remember. Since reviewing basic cards does not bring immediate advantage, I wonder if it is better to discard those cards and re-learn the knowledge when I actually need it, or to invest times expecting it will save me a lot of time someday. Do you review your basic subjects regularly, or simply re-learn when you need it?","[D] As a researcher, should I regularly review the basic math, ML, etc?

1016,MachineLearning,[D] I just found out that my 1 years' worth of research has already been published.,"I'm a PhD student in the middle of my studies. A year ago I had an idea  about designing a neural network for medical image segmentation using  shape priors. I have done a quick literature review at that time  (although I admit, it might not have been thorough enough) and I found  that no one really tried to use those shape priors before, especially  for the task that i wanted to use them on (these descriptors would fit  the specific task especially well). I worked hard on the implementation,  designing the network architecture, writing the article and  understanding all the necessary mathematical proofs/theorems related to  this task. I just submitted the article a few weeks ago (no word from it yet), and today, I  found an article on arxiv (no citations) that has been published this  spring and basically uses the same idea for the same task as I did. The  network architecture is different than mine and the performance  evaluation is different, but the main selling point of my article, the  usage of these shape priors has already been published. I am a bit  devastated at this point because this would have been my first 1st  author paper and I really put a lot of effort and thought into this,  only to discover that my idea has already been discovered before.  Obviously I need to do a much more thorough literature review next time  so that this doesn't happen again, but besides that, I don't know what  else I could do to mitigate the damage that has been done to my  motivation. I am even considering quitting PhD at this moment because I  feel like I wasted a lot of time because of my stupidity. Has anything  similar happened to you before? Do you have any advice? How could you  cope with similar issues in your career?","[D] I just found out that my 1 years' worth of research has already been published. I'm a PhD student in the middle of my studies.
